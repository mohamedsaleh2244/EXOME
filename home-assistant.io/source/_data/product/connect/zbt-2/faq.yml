  - question: What’s the difference between Connect ZBT-1 and ZBT-2?
    answer: '<p>Connect ZBT-1 (formerly known as SkyConnect) was our first Zigbee/Thread adapter released in 2022. It is now discontinued and has been replaced with Connect ZBT-2. Connect ZBT-2 is a step up in capability compared to our previous adapter, providing peak performance and all packaged in a sleek, open design. Here is a short comparison between the two generations of devices.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Connect ZBT-1 (First-generation Connect platform)</th><th>Connect ZBT-2 (Second-generation Connect platform)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Antenna</strong></td><td>Small and internal</td><td>Highly optimized antenna and base</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Transmit</strong></td><td>Maximized for the protocol</td><td>Maximized for the protocol</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Speed (Baudrate)</strong></td><td>115200</td><td>460800 - consistently improves device responsiveness</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zigbee/Thread Chip</strong></td><td>Silicon Labs MG21</td><td>Silicon Labs MG24 - faster operation and sensitivity for weak signals</td></tr><tr><td><strong>USB chip</strong></td><td>Silicon Labs CP2102N - great for USB</td><td>ESP32-S3 - great for USB and expandable</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ease of modding</strong></td><td>Hard to open, easy to flash firmware</td><td>Easy to open (no clips or glue, exposed pins and pads) and easy to flash firmware</td></tr></tbody></table>'
  - question: Does Connect ZBT-2 work with Zigbee2MQTT?
    answer: 'Yes, Connect ZBT-2 is being used by many people with Zigbee2MQTT, and they are seeing great results. There is documentation to help support migrating to a new adapter, like Connect ZBT-2, <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/faq/#how-do-i-migrate-from-one-adapter-to-another" target="_blank">on Zigbee2MQTT</a>.'
  - question: Why do I have to choose between Zigbee and Thread? Why not both?
    answer: 'Connect ZBT-2 cannot do both Zigbee and Thread simultaneously. This technology is often called “multiprotocol” or “MultiPAN”. Though it is theoretically possible with the hardware within Connect ZBT-2, in our experience, this functionality doesn’t work well, and we don’t plan to implement it. We previously thoroughly tested multiprotocol with our Connect ZBT-1 adapter and found its operation to be inconsistent, often causing device stability issues. We do not believe multiprotocol is suitable for operation in the home, and strongly recommend dedicating a device to each protocol.'
  - question: Can I migrate from my old adapter?
    answer: 'Yes, we’ve put together easy migration wizards for both Zigbee and Thread, which help migrate the vast majority of adapters. Some adapters require extra steps before migrating to Connect ZBT-2 (for example, Conbee sticks require a specific firmware to facilitate the migration). Please visit our documentation for specific instructions on how to <a href="https://support.nabucasa.com/hc/sections/29400567268253" target="_blank">migrate your adapter</a>.'
  - question: Why are you not using Power-over-Ethernet (PoE)?
    answer: 'Though PoE is a cool technology, we have focused this product on simplicity and peak performance. PoE has become easier to use and offers performance levels that make its convenience an appealing trade-off for many users, but it didn’t fit Connect ZBT-2’s design goals. PoE is something we continue to explore; in fact, we recently produced experimental firmware for our <a href="/blog/2025/10/13/portable-z-wave-with-wifi-and-poe/">Connect ZWA-2 adapter to operate over PoE</a>. We currently do not have plans to make a specific version of Connect ZBT-2 with built-in PoE, but we will look at other ways to have it work with PoE.'
  - question: What devices is it compatible with?
    answer: 'If it is a Zigbee-certified device or Matter-certified device that uses Thread, it should work out of the box with Home Assistant. Home Assistant offers some of the strongest device compatibility of any smart home ecosystem. Some newer devices may require some configuration by our community, so it is best to <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/22" target="_blank">check our community</a> for device compatibility.'
  - question: Does Connect ZBT-2 work with Matter?
    answer: 'Yes, Home Assistant is officially Matter certified, and always works to support the latest versions, giving it great device compatibility. Some Matter devices use Wi-Fi, while others may use Thread (specifically battery-powered devices), and that’s when Connect ZBT-2 steps in to help you connect Matter devices. If you’re looking to add Matter devices that use Thread, follow our instructions to <a href="https://support.nabucasa.com/hc/articles/31347057208989" target="_blank">dedicate your device to Thread</a>.'
  - question: Can Connect ZBT-2 be used as a repeater?
    answer: 'No, at the moment Connect ZBT-2 does not have this capability. This is technically possible, and we’ll explore enabling this, but there is no guarantee that this will happen.'
  - question: Can I use Connect ZBT-2 as a Thread border router separately from Home Assistant?
    answer: 'No, this capability is not built into Connect ZBT-2. There are several technical hurdles that would make this complex to implement, and more research is needed to see if this is possible.'
  - question: Why is Connect ZBT-2 so big?
    answer: 'The size is all about physics, and what’s needed to optimize its ability to transmit and receive the radio frequencies used by Zigbee and Thread (2.4 GHz). Both the antenna and base are the optimal size to maximize the adapter’s performance.'
  - question: Will you be supporting Zigbee 4.0?
    answer: 'We’re reviewing the Zigbee 4.0 spec now, and we believe it should be possible to update Connect ZBT-2 to support this version. It would require the Zigbee firmware in Connect ZBT-2 to be updated, along with Home Assistant gaining support.'
