## The issue

The Home Assistant Supervisor is only supported on Home Assistant OS.

## The solution

You need to reinstall the host machine running the Supervisor using Home Assistant OS.

The best approach here is to [create a backup](/common-tasks/general/#backups) of your
current installation, then reinstall your system using Home Assistant OS. During
[Onboarding of Home Assistant](/getting-started/onboarding/), choose to **Restore from
backup**.
