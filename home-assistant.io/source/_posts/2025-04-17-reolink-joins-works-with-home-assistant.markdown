We're excited to announce that [Reolink](https://reolink.com/) is the latest partner to join the [Works with Home Assistant](https://works-with.home-assistant.io/) program.

Just recently, we had [blinds join the program](/blog/2025/03/27/motionblinds-joins-wwha/), and now we have Reolink bringing the first certified cameras and doorbells. Reolink has certified a wide range of their devices including battery-powered and wired options, as well as devices with Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) and Wi-Fi connectivity.

When someone in the Home Assistant community asks for camera recommendations, Reolink often tops the list. This strong reputation is well-earned, as they prioritize local control, don't require cloud connectivity for their advanced features, and support open protocols whenever possible.<!--more-->

## Seeing eye-to-eye

Founded in 2009, Reolink has been building video security solutions for nearly any setup---whether you need a monster 10-camera PoE system or just a few Wi-Fi-connected cameras. They've done this while closely aligning with the Open Home values of privacy, choice, and sustainability.

First and foremost, they've put in great options for maintaining privacy, specifically prioritizing storing video locally, with cloud storage as an optional extra. Files aren't locked down---wired cameras support multiple streaming protocols, while battery models can send clips to an FTP server---giving users better choice and control.

While other brands lock features like motion detection behind subscriptions, Reolink devices work fully locally---even without internet access, all advertised features will work now and into the future. With support for streaming protocols and fully local use, these cameras are set to work for years, which is a win for the planet 💚.

It's amazing that there is a security camera brand that respects the Open Home values while supporting all the latest features---like resolutions greater than 4K, long battery life, PoE, solar power, color night vision, advanced motion and object detection.

## Picture perfect integration

Another reason these cameras get recommended so often is the platinum-quality [Reolink integration](/integrations/reolink/). This ensures user-friendly features like automatic device discovery, smooth setup, firmware updates, and detailed documentation. Critically, [platinum integrations](/docs/quality_scale/#-platinum) include exceptionally efficient and well-written code, improving overall system stability and reliability.

All Works with Home Assistant-certified devices feature top-quality integrations, but what makes this one special is that it was built by the Home Assistant community. Huge thanks to the Reolink team and [@StarkillerOG](https://github.com/starKillerOG) for the effort that brought it to the Platinum level late last year.

Reolink is a big fan of our active and engaged community and joined Works with Home Assistant to continue this close connection to them.

In case you didn't know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/), and the support of [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) subscribers funds this work.

## Closed circuit

In case you haven't noticed, Works with Home Assistant has already had a big start to the year (Reolink, [Apollo Automations](/blog/2025/02/27/apollo-joins-wwha/), and [Motionblinds](/blog/2025/03/27/motionblinds-joins-wwha/)), and this is thanks to your support. This momentum is only just building, and we have many more announcements coming! In case you missed it, our State of the Open Home last weekend had many other updates on Works with Home Assistant.
