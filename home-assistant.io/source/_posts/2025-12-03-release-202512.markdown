Home Assistant 2025.12! 🎄

As the year winds down and the holidays approach, we're closing out 2025 with a release that's all about giving you more control and a little bit of magic. ✨

This month, we're unveiling **Home Assistant Labs**, a brand-new space where you can preview features before they go mainstream. And what better way to kick it off than with **Winter mode**? ❄️ Enable it and watch snowflakes drift across your dashboard. It's completely unnecessary, utterly delightful, and exactly the kind of thing we love to build. ❄️

But that's just the beginning. We've been working on making {% term automations %} more intuitive over the past releases, and this release finally delivers **purpose-specific triggers and conditions**. Instead of thinking in (numeric) states, you can now simply say "When a light turns on" or "If the climate is heating". It's automation building the way our mind works, as it should be. 🧠

Oh, and if you're looking to level up your Zigbee or Thread network, check out the [Home Assistant Connect ZBT-2](/blog/2025/11/19/home-assistant-connect-zbt-2/) we released last month. It's four times faster and has a gorgeous new antenna design that you'll actually want to display on your desk. 📡

From all of us working on Home Assistant:

**Thank you for an amazing 2025!** ❤️

Happy holidays, and enjoy the release!

## Home Assistant Labs 🧪

When we develop new features for Home Assistant, we often find ourselves in a tricky spot. A feature might be fully built and tested, but we're not entirely sure if it's the right fit for everyone just yet. Maybe we want to gather some real-world feedback first, or perhaps we want to see how the community uses it before committing to keeping it around forever.

That's where **Home Assistant Labs** comes in! 🧪

Labs is a brand-new place in Home Assistant that gives you a sneak peek at features we're working on. These are not unfinished experiments or unstable beta features. They are fully functional and tested, but they might change or even disappear based on feedback. We are committed to building in the open, and we want to give more people the choice to hop into the lab with us. By joining us, your feedback will directly help refine these features for the entire community.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new Home Assistant Labs panel with preview features you can enable or disable." src="/images/blog/2025-12/labs.png" />

The very first preview feature available in Labs is **Winter mode** ❄️, inspired by [a community post on Reddit][snowflakes-reddit] originally created by u/Possible-Week-5815. Enable it, and watch your Home Assistant interface transform into a winter wonderland with falling snow. A fun way to get into the holiday spirit!

[snowflakes-reddit]: https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1p2yxqm/i_added_falling_snowflakes_to_my_dashboard_again/

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup option when you enable a preview feature." src="/images/blog/2025-12/labs-enable-with-backup.png" />

When you enable a preview feature, you can also choose to create a backup first, just to be safe. And if you change your mind? Simply disable it again. No restart required!

Preview features are off by default, and enabling them won't affect your existing setup. It's completely optional, so if you prefer to stick with the battle-proven experience, that's totally fine. But if you're curious and want to explore what's coming next, Labs is the place to be.

But what was the first Labs preview feature we put in there? Well, it's a big one...

## Purpose-specific triggers and conditions

Almost [two years ago](/blog/2024/01/03/release-20241/), we released a new {% term automation %} editor that unwrapped all our {% term actions %} and made them easier to understand. Instead of a single, obscure "Call service" action, you now see clear options like "Light: Turn on" or "Media Player: Set Volume".

Ever since, we've been wondering: could we do the same for {% term triggers %} and {% term conditions %}? Instead of relying on technical, state-based options, what if we could offer intuitive alternatives that just make sense? Options like "When a light turns on" or "If a light is on".

That idea set a two-year plan in motion, and today it's finally becoming a reality.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new purpose-specific triggers and conditions in the automation editor." src="/images/blog/2025-12/purpose-specific-triggers.png" />

Along the way, we discovered something interesting: many of you take a "target-first" approach when building {% term automations %}. You think about _what_ you want to automate (a {% term device %}, an {% term entity %}, or an {% term area %}) before thinking about _how_ to automate it (which action to perform or which trigger to use). This release embraces that mindset with a completely new way to build automations.

Purpose-specific triggers and conditions are now provided directly by {% term domains %} like [Light], [Climate], [Fan], and others, covering the most common automation use cases.

These new triggers and conditions fully support targeting. This means you can trigger an automation when _any_ light in your living room turns on, without having to list them one by one or create a group beforehand. Targeting an area keeps things simple: it's always aligned with how your home is organized, and you don't have to update anything when you add or remove devices.

[Light]: /integrations/light
[Climate]: /integrations/climate
[Fan]: /integrations/fan

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new target-first picker for triggers, conditions, and actions." src="/images/blog/2025-12/trigger-target-picker.png" />

{% term Labels %} are supported too! You can now check if any of your Christmas lights are on. Perfect timing for the holidays! 🎄

We've also introduced a new way to pick triggers, conditions, and actions that fits this target-first approach. You can navigate your home by {% term floor %}, then area, then device, and see exactly which options are available for each target. It's a much more intuitive way to build {% term automations %}.

This feature is still being refined, so we've made it available as a preview feature in Labs. Head over to {% my labs title="**Settings** > **System** > **Labs**" %} to enable it and help us shape the future of automation building!

## More dashboard improvements!

We have a lot of dashboard improvements to share in this release! From better default dashboard management to an improved Home dashboard, we have been busy making your Home Assistant experience even better.

### Set a system-wide default dashboard

Picking a default dashboard is now a system-level setting that takes effect instantly for all users on your Home Assistant installation. The dashboard you choose will appear at the top of the sidebar, replacing the current default.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the Dashboard configuration page and the option to make any dashboard default in the three dots menu." src="/images/blog/2025-12/set-dashboard-default-system.png" />

But don't worry, personal preferences still matter! We added a new setting in your {% my profile title="**User profile**" %} where you can override the system default and set your own preferred dashboard.

If you set your phone to one dashboard and your wall tablet to another, they’ll now both revert to the default dashboard. If you want your wall tablet to use a different dashboard than your other devices, we recommend giving it a separate user profile that you can customize however you want.

### Reorder areas and floors

When using the built-in dashboard experiences (Home, Lights, Security, and others), one of the main pain points was the strict ordering of {% term areas %} (alphabetically) and {% term floors %} (numerically by level). This often didn't make sense in a real home, where your guest bathroom shouldn't appear before your living room, and the attic is rarely more relevant than the main floor.

Now you can go to {% my areas title="**Settings** > **Areas, labels & zones**" %} and use the new _Reorder floors and areas_ menu to manually drag and drop any area or floor to reorder them. Your changes will instantly apply to all built-in dashboards that show areas and floors.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the reorder areas and floors menu." src="/images/blog/2025-12/reorder-areas-menu.png" />

### Experimental dashboards have graduated

With the launch of Labs, we retired the experimental flag from the dashboard creation list. The **Home** dashboard can now be found in the dashboard list (still not visible by default), and the **Areas** dashboard has evolved into Home, so we've removed it for now. If you’re using the Areas dashboard, it will continue to work; you just won’t be able to create another.

{% note %}
We want to keep hearing your voice! Share your experience with us [in the Home dashboard survey](https://forms.gle/akJJNZGMadkBP7Xw5) and help us improve every step of the way. And of course [join us on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1351536906437005313) to work together on the future of dashboards.
{% endnote %}

### Home dashboard improvements

We added a new sidebar to the Home dashboard that gathers quick access links we think are useful for you. There's also a nicer area and floor layout that uses space more efficiently. On a more technical level, the Home dashboard is now a proper built-in dashboard and shows up in the dashboard list.

{% important %}
There is a chance your current favorites might disappear in this release and need to be re-added. This is due to the migration of this dashboard from a strategy to a built-in dashboard.
{% endimportant %}

### Undo and redo in the dashboard editor

The dashboard editor now includes the [undo and redo feature](/blog/2025/10/01/release-202510/#undoredo) that we added in 2025.10 to the {% term automation %} and {% term script %} editor. This allows you to experiment safely while editing your dashboards. You can undo up to 75 changes or restore them with a single click, making editing dashboards faster and less stressful.

Thanks to [@jpbede] for implementing this handy feature!

## Power and water in the Energy dashboard

The Energy dashboard has been helping you track your energy and gas usage for years now, and this release brings two great additions: **real-time power monitoring** and **downstream water tracking**.

### Real-time power monitoring

Until now, the Energy dashboard was all about energy: the cumulative kWh you've consumed or produced over time. But sometimes you want to know what's happening _right now_. How much power is that appliance actually drawing? Is your solar system producing at this very moment?

With this release, you can now configure **power sensors** alongside your energy sensors. Track your real-time grid consumption, see how much you're exporting back to the grid, and watch those watts flow in real-time. The power configuration options now appear alongside energy settings for each source or device, and new power graphs let you see your power consumption throughout the day.

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/dashboards/energy/power-sources.png' alt='Screenshot showing the power sources graph'>
<img src='/images/dashboards/energy/sankey.png' alt='Screenshot showing the power sankey graph'>
</p>

### Downstream water meters

The Energy dashboard has been tracking your water consumption for a while now, but it was missing something: the ability to see _where_ all that water is actually going. Just like you can track individual devices for energy consumption, you can now add **downstream water meters** to break down your water usage.

Got a smart irrigation controller? A water softener with a flow meter? A separate meter for your pool? Now you can track them all and see exactly how your water consumption is distributed across different uses.

There's also a brand-new **water sankey card** that visualizes your water flow, just like the energy sankey diagram you already know. It's a great way to see where your water is going at a glance.

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/dashboards/energy/water-sankey.png' alt='Screenshot showing the water sankey card visualizing water consumption'>
The new water sankey card shows where your water is going at a glance.
</p>

### New energy layout

To make room for this new functionality, the Energy dashboard has been reorganized. Don't worry: if you only have energy configured, you'll still see the same dashboard. But if you add water, gas, or power, the dashboard will be split into several tabs.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-12/new-energy-dashboard-layout.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new Energy dashboard layout with tabs for energy, water, gas, and power." />

### Integration quality scale achievements

One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our [integration quality scale]. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible user experience.

This release, we celebrate several {% term integrations %} that have improved their quality scale:

- **2 integrations reached platinum** 🏆
  - [Brother Printer], thanks to [@bieniu]
  - [Shelly], thanks to [@davidrapan]

- **1 integration reached gold** 🥇
  - [Google Assistant SDK], thanks to [@tronikos]

- **2 integrations reached silver** 🥈
  - [LCN], thanks to [@alengwenus]
  - [Telegram bot], thanks to [@hanwg]

- **2 integrations reached bronze** 🥉
  - [Music Assistant], thanks to [@OzGav]
  - [Transmission], thanks to [@andrew-codechimp]

This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers. The effort and dedication required to reach these quality levels is significant, as it involves extensive testing, documentation, error handling, and often complete rewrites of parts of the integration.

A big thank you to all the contributors involved! 👏

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone to set up and use.

The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[DuckDNS]**, done by [@tr4nt0r]

[@tr4nt0r]: https://github.com/tr4nt0r
[DuckDNS]: /integrations/duckdns

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are no longer available as of this release:

- **Dominos Pizza**: The Dominos Pizza integration has been removed. The integration no longer functions and its underlying source has been unmaintained since 2019.
- **Flick Electric**: The Flick Electric integration has been removed. All customers of the Flick Electric company have already been moved to Meridian Energy. The service this integration used is already non-functional.
- The following integrations have been removed as they are incompatible with the currently supported installation methods:
  - **Bluetooth Tracker**
  - **CUPS**
  - **Decora**
  - **dlib Face Detect**

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:

- New template math functions! [@akx] added `clamp`, `wrap`, and `remap` to manipulate numbers in your templates. Awesome!
- The [activity card] now supports filtering by state, making it easier to see specific events. Nice one, [@karwosts]!
- [@MindFreeze] added `min` and `max` options to the [bar gauge feature] for tile cards, giving you more control over the gauge range.
- You can now delete [helpers] directly from the helpers panel, without having to open them first. Thanks, [@frenck]!
- The [blueprints] panel now shows how many automations and scripts use each blueprint. Great for keeping track, [@EarMaster]!
- [@timmo001] added a handy trick: double-click the automation editor sidebar to reset its width.
- Labels now show up on the device information card, making it easier to see how your devices are organized. Thanks again, [@timmo001]!

### Get insight into your AI conversations

Ever played around with AI in Home Assistant and wondered what data is actually being sent?

[@balloob] upgraded the voice assistant debug interface, and you can now inspect the system prompt that tells the AI how to behave, along with any tool calls it made to generate your answer.

This makes it much easier to figure out why the AI decided to skip over that one {% term entity %}, or why it called a specific tool. You can find the debug interface in the voice assistant configuration panel.

### Add entities to Android widgets and favorites

If you're using the [Home Assistant Companion app for Android](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/getting_started/), there's a handy new feature waiting for you! Starting with app version 2025.11, you can now add {% term entities %} to widgets and Android Auto favorites directly from the entity's more info dialog.

<p class="img">
<img src="/images/blog/2025-12/android-add-to-widget.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new 'Add to' option in the more info dialog for an entity in the Home Assistant Android app.">
</p>

With just a few taps, you can:

- Add [widgets](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/integrations/android-widgets) for quick control of entities right from your home screen
- Set entities as Android Auto favorites, making them quickly accessible in your car

No more deep-diving into app settings! The **Add to** option appears in the more info dialog with options tailored to the entity you're viewing. For example, adding a media player widget is only available for media players.

This is a first step in integrating native mobile features directly into the Home Assistant interface. Future releases will expand this with support for creating shortcuts, tiles, and watch favorites.

Thanks for this great addition, [@TimoPtr]! 🙏

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Core and Supervised installation methods, and 32-bit systems" %}

After a 6-month deprecation period, support for the Home Assistant Core and Home Assistant Supervised installation methods, as well as all 32-bit system architectures (`i386`, `armhf`, and `armv7`), has now been fully removed.

These installation methods and architectures will no longer receive updates, including security updates. If you are still using one of these installation methods or architectures, please migrate to a supported installation method and architecture as soon as possible to continue receiving updates and support.

For more information on this change, read the [Deprecating Core and Supervised installation methods, and 32-bit systems](/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/) blog post.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Hive" %}

Hive has removed support for their security products. We have removed the alarm control panel from the integration, as the Hive APIs no longer support these products.

([@KJonline] - [#156184]) ([hive docs])

[@KJonline]: https://github.com/KJonline
[#156184]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/156184
[hive docs]: /integrations/hive/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Templates" %}

The `issues()` templating method used to return all issues, including fixed issues. From now on, only active issues are returned.

([@jbouwh] - [#156274])

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#156274]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/156274

{% enddetails %}

{% details "go2rtc" %}

It is now required to set a `username` and `password` when enabling the debug UI.

[#157008]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/157008
[go2rtc docs]: /integrations/go2rtc/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "UniFi Protect" %}

The legacy license plate event sensor has been removed from the UniFi Protect integration, as it no longer functions with Protect 6 and newer. The UniFi Protect integration has not been compatible with Protect versions older than 6 for quite some time.

This sensor has been replaced with a new **Vehicle Detection Event** entity that provides significantly more functionality, including license plate recognition, vehicle type detection, color detection, and confidence scores. The new event entity fires with a 3-second delay to ensure optimal thumbnail and <abbr title="License Plate Recognition">LPR</abbr> data quality.

For more information and automation examples, see the [Vehicle Detection Event documentation](/integrations/unifiprotect/#vehicle-detection-event).

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Xbox" %}

- The Xbox media browser has been completely overhauled to support multiple accounts and introduce a range of other improvements. As part of this update, the format of the media-source identifiers has been changed as well.

- The **following** and **followers** sensors introduced in the last release previously included friends in their counts. After a recent API update, friends are no longer included.
