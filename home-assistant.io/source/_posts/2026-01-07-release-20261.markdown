Happy New Year! 🥂

I hope you had a wonderful holiday, spending time with your loved ones. We're kicking off 2026 with a smaller release, as our contributors and maintainers have been enjoying some well-deserved time off as well. But don't worry, there's still plenty of good stuff in this release!

Home Assistant 2026.1 brings a refreshed Home dashboard experience on mobile, with summary cards right at your fingertips without extra taps. We’ve also made it easier than ever to navigate to the protocol connecting your devices, such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, Thread and more.

For automation enthusiasts, we’re continuing our work on our even more "human-friendly" triggers, which can be enabled via Home Assistant Labs, so you can build automations using easy-to-understand language instead of technical state changes, like initiating automations if a button is pressed or someone arrives home.

On the integrations front, we welcome eight new integrations to the family, including pet tracking with Fressnapf, energy monitoring with eGauge, and smart heating control with Watts Vision +. Plus, improvements to existing integrations from our amazing community contributors.

I wish you a happy and healthy 2026! Enjoy the release!

## Home dashboard improvements

The [Home dashboard](/dashboards/dashboards/#home-dashboard) continues to evolve! In [the previous release](/blog/2025/12/03/release-202512/#more-dashboard-improvements), we introduced a brand-new sidebar layout, weather tiles, and energy distribution summaries. This release takes it even further with a streamlined mobile experience and better device management.

### Streamlined mobile navigation

On mobile devices, the Home dashboard now displays summary cards (like lights, climate, security, media players, weather, and energy) directly at the top of the view, followed by your favorites and areas. This replaces the previous tab-based navigation, giving you instant access to everything that matters without any extra taps.

<img src='/images/blog/2026-01/home-dashboard-mobile.png' alt='Screenshot showing the Home dashboard on mobile with summary cards at the top.' class='no-shadow' />

The desktop experience remains unchanged, with summaries displayed in the sidebar under the **For you** heading.

### New devices page

Ever wondered where your devices went after you removed them from an area? A new **Devices** page now appears on the Home dashboard, showing all devices that aren't currently assigned to a specific area. This makes it easy to find and control those "orphaned" devices without hunting through the settings.

<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2026-01/home-dashboard-devices.png' alt='Screenshot showing the Devices page on the Home dashboard for unassigned devices.'/>The new Devices page shows devices not assigned to any area.</p>

## Purpose-specific triggers and conditions progress

In [the previous release](/blog/2025/12/03/release-202512/#purpose-specific-triggers-and-conditions), we introduced purpose-specific triggers and conditions. Instead of thinking in technical state changes, you can now simply pick things like "When a light turns on" or "If the climate is heating" when building your automations.

<img src='/images/blog/2025-12/purpose-specific-triggers.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new purpose-specific triggers and conditions in the automation editor.' class='no-shadow' />

This feature is still being refined in {% my labs title="**Home Assistant Labs**" %}, but this release adds a _lot_ more trigger types, making this new approach even more useful. Here is an overview of all the new triggers added in this release:

- **Button** triggers fire when a button entity has been pressed.
- **Climate** triggers now cover all common scenarios. You can trigger on HVAC mode changes, target temperature changes, or when the target temperature crosses a threshold. There are also triggers for current temperature and humidity changes, and even target humidity changes.
- **Device tracker** triggers let you automate based on when a device entered or left home, with support for the first device arriving, last device leaving, or any change. Don't worry, person-specific triggers are coming soon, the device tracker ones were simply available sooner.
- **Humidifier** triggers will fire when a humidifier turns on or off, starts humidifying, or starts drying. You can also trigger on humidity changes or when humidity crosses a threshold.
- **Light** triggers let you automate based on brightness changes or when brightness crosses a specific threshold.
- **Lock** triggers can now fire when a lock is locked, unlocked, opened, or jammed.
- **Scene** triggers fire when a scene is activated.
- **Siren** triggers fire when sirens are turned on or off.
- **Update** trigger fires when an update becomes available.

As the new purpose-specific triggers and conditions all support targeting something bigger than a simple entity (an area, a floor, or even a label), we also redesigned how the target gets displayed on the automation flow.

The goal of this change is to allow you to quickly glance at your automation, and understand its purpose.

<img src='/images/blog/2026-01/target_summary_automation_editor.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new target summary in the automation editor.' class='no-shadow' />

Head over to {% my labs title="**Settings** > **System** > **Labs**" %} to enable purpose-specific triggers and conditions and give them a try!

## Easier navigation to protocol dashboards

For an organization that loves the open standards that seamlessly connect our devices, we sure didn’t promote them enough! Most people didn’t even know that Home Assistant has dedicated dashboards for protocols like Zigbee, Z-Wave, and more.

This release reorganizes the **Settings** page to give these open protocols a more prominent spot. The protocols section now appears right after the core settings, making it much easier to find all the different ways you’re connecting your devices and quickly access some very useful protocol-specific configurations.

<img src='/images/blog/2026-01/protocol-dashboards.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new protocols section in the Settings page with Matter, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Thread, Bluetooth, KNX, and Insteon.' class='no-shadow' />

The menu items only appear when you have the corresponding integration set up, so you'll only see what's relevant to your setup.

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone to set up and use.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[Hikvision]**, done by [@ptarjan]
- **[VIVOTEK]**, done by [@HarlemSquirrel]

[VIVOTEK]: /integrations/vivotek

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:

- If you monitor your home's oil tank or other slow flow rates, you might appreciate the new **gallons per day** unit of volume flow rate added by [@StaleLoafOfBread]. This unit is particularly useful for tracking daily consumption rates of heating oil or similar resources.
- Got a Matter speaker? [@lboue] added volume control support to the [Matter] integration, exposing a volume slider entity for Matter speakers using the LevelControl cluster.
- The [statistics graph card][dashboard-statistics-graph] now includes a link to the history panel in its header, just like the history graph card already had. Selecting the link takes you directly to the history with the same entities and time range pre-selected, thanks to [@joepio].
- When using the [state badge element][dashboard-state-badge] in your picture elements card, you can now set a custom `name` option, giving you more flexibility in your dashboard designs, thanks to [@ildar170975].
- In 2025.11 we [improved the logging efficiency][improved-logging-efficiency] by disabling the duplicated log file. This release adds a [new configuration option][duplicate-log-file-option] to re-enable it if needed. If you are using the official Terminal & SSH add-on, make sure it is updated to 9.22.0 or higher to be able to use that option. The Advanced SSH & Web Terminal add-on has not been updated yet, but will be soon.
- For integration developers: [@bramkragten] added a new **choose selector**, allowing users to select between different input types in the UI. You'll start seeing this pop up in various places where flexible input is needed.

### Energy dashboard date picker

In [the previous release](/blog/2025/12/03/release-202512/#power-and-water-in-the-energy-dashboard), the Energy dashboard received a big update with real-time power monitoring and downstream water tracking. However, some of you noticed that navigating between periods required scrolling back up, making it harder to compare data while looking at graphs further down the page.

This release fixes that! The date picker is now sticky at the bottom of the screen, so you can easily switch between days, weeks, or months without losing sight of the graph you're viewing. This also makes it much easier to access on mobile devices.

<img src='/images/blog/2026-01/energy-dashboard-period-selector.png' alt='Screenshot showing the Energy dashboard with the date picker fixed at the bottom of the screen.' class='no-shadow' />

### ESPHome action responses

[ESPHome 2025.12] introduced a powerful new feature called [API action responses][esphome-action-responses], enabling true bidirectional communication between your ESPHome devices and Home Assistant. With this release, Home Assistant now fully supports receiving these responses!

Previously, when calling an action on an ESPHome device, communication was one-way: you could send a command, but the device couldn't send structured data back. Now, your ESPHome devices can return JSON data in response to actions, unlocking new possibilities like querying device configuration, reading sensor values on demand, or retrieving diagnostic information.

This is particularly useful for actions that answer questions rather than perform tasks. For example, you could create an action that returns your device's current Wi-Fi signal strength, firmware version, or any custom sensor readings, all as structured data you can use in your automations.

To get started, check out the [ESPHome documentation on action responses][esphome-action-responses] for configuration examples.

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Coolmaster" %}

The climate entities provided by the Coolmaster integration now use `medium` for the medium fan mode; before this change, it was `med`. If your automations are using `med` when setting or querying the fan speed, you'll have to change it to `medium`.

[coolmaster docs]: /integrations/coolmaster/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Tailscale" %}

The "Supports hairpinning" binary sensor has been removed from the Tailscale integration. According to the official Tailscale API documentation, this information is no longer tracked and will always return null.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "UniFi Protect" %}

Select entity state values have been changed from their original mixed-case format to snake_case format with proper translations. This improves consistency and enables proper localization support.

Affected select entities include: chime type, recording mode, infrared mode, status light mode, HDR mode, doorbell text, LCD message, and others.

Example changes:

- Chime type: `Mechanical` → `mechanical`, `Digital` → `digital`
- Recording mode: `Always` → `always`, `Detections` → `detections`, `Never` → `never`
- Infrared mode: `Auto` → `auto`, `On` → `on`, `AutoNoLEDsOn` → `auto_no_leds_on`
- Status light mode: `On` → `on`, `Off` → `off`, `OnWhenDark` → `on_when_dark`
- HDR mode: `Auto` → `auto`, `On` → `on`, `Off` → `off`

If you have automations, scripts, or templates that check or set the state of UniFi Protect select entities, you need to update them to use the new snake_case values. The UI will continue to display properly translated, human-readable text.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Telegram bot" %}

Allowing extra/unused parameters has been removed from the action for Telegram bot. Only users who have used undefined parameters for Telegram bot actions are affected. If you are affected, remove such parameters from your automations and scripts. Supported parameters can be found in the [Telegram bot notification actions](/integrations/telegram_bot/#notification-actions) documentation.

[telegram_bot docs]: /integrations/telegram_bot/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "VeSync" %}

The `advancedSleep` fan mode has been changed to `advanced_sleep`. If you have automations or scripts using this fan mode, please update them accordingly.
