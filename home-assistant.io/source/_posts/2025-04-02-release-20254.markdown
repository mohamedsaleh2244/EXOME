Home Assistant 2025.4! 🎉

It's April 2nd, so this is definitely not an April Fool's joke! 😃

But before diving into this month’s release, I want to quickly highlight
something you might have missed—something I’m extremely excited about:

**[The State of the Open Home 2025](/blog/2025/03/26/state-of-the-open-home-2025-announcement/)**!

Yes, you read that right! On **Saturday, April 12th, 2025**, we'll be
[streaming a big live event on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4Vctz1_KYE),
sharing our vision for the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org),
including the future of Home Assistant. Don't miss it!

Alright, back to the release! As I was saying, it’s April already, and we have
another fantastic release lined up for you.

The big news is the introduction of our **new experimental Areas dashboard**,
which might evolve to become the default dashboard in the future. If you’re like
me—not really a UI-oriented person—you’re going to love this one! 🤩

My personal absolute favorite feature this month is something I’ve dreamed of
ever since we started working on voice assistants: **the ability for your
assistant to start a conversation proactively!** This is a game
changer—**no other** voice assistant on the market can do this!
I’m going to have so much fun with this. 😃

If you’re a power user who loves templates, don’t worry—we’ve got you covered
too! This release ships with **a bunch of new template functions**, making your
life a lot easier.

Enjoy the release!

## Dashboards

We’re making dashboards smarter—automagically!

Dashboards allow you to monitor and control different aspects of your home.
They are one of the main interfaces for interacting with Home Assistant,
and a key contributor to what we call the Home Approval Factor—how useful
and welcoming your smart home feels to everyone who lives in it.

Over the past year, we have focused on making dashboards easier to create and
customize. We introduced the powerful drag-and-drop sections view and plenty
of new tile card features.

We’re going a step further by delivering a dashboard that’s immediately
relevant, saving you time and effort while still leaving room for personal
touches.

### A new experimental Areas dashboard

Until now, our default dashboard has served as a simple starting point—a list
of {% term entities %} grouped by {% term area %} or {% term device %}
{% term domains %}. While helpful for beginners, it quickly becomes limited as
a smart home grows. We’ve learned that while some users enjoy building their
own dashboards, many simply want something that works for their household.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot viewing an area of the new experimental Areas dashboard" src="/images/blog/2025-04/areas-dashboard-detail.png" />

The new experimental [Areas dashboard](/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard) automatically generates a ready-to-use
dashboard based on the areas you’ve set up in your home. It uses [sections](/dashboards/sections/) and
[tile cards](/dashboards/tile/) for a modern, clean, and intuitive look—instantly. No more starting
from a blank slate!

Each [area](/docs/organizing/areas/) now has its own dedicated page, giving you a clear and organized view
of the devices in that space. Entities, such as lights, covers, cameras,
and more, are automatically grouped by domain so you can easily locate the ones
you need.

Want to tweak it? _Yes, you can_! You can rearrange, show, or hide entities to
suit your preferences. At the top of each area page, temperature and humidity
badges quickly indicate room comfort levels, which are configurable in the
area’s settings.

On top of all that, the Overview page brings it all together, showing all your
areas in one place. Each section corresponds to a room in your home, and just
like with the area pages, you can rearrange, show, or hide areas here as well,
based on your preferences.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the overview page of the new Areas dashboard" src="/images/blog/2025-04/areas-dashboard-overview.png" />

If you haven’t [organized your devices into areas](/docs/organizing/areas/) yet, now’s the perfect time to
start—it’s key to unlocking this new dashboard experience. To get
started with the [Areas dashboard](/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard), go to
**{% my lovelace_dashboards title="Settings > Dashboards" %}**, and select
**Add Dashboard** in the bottom right, next select the **Areas (experimental)**
option from the dialog:

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the dialog when adding a new dashboard, showing the new option to add the new experimental Area dashboard" src="/images/blog/2025-04/areas-experimental-dialog.png" />

The new experimental [Areas dashboard](/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard) previews what’s to come. We’ve learned from
our users that they organize their homes in different ways—by rooms,
by function, by device, and more. They often combine all of the above,
and therefore, our upcoming default dashboard will accommodate
all these methods of [organization](/docs/organizing/).

Over time, this foundation will grow into a flexible system that adapts to
your priorities, whether that’s keeping an eye on security, managing energy use,
going through your family calendar and chores, learning about the weather,
or simply watching your pets.

Please note that this is experimental, meaning it is subject to change and may
not always work as intended. We would love your feedback if you notice some
aspects we can improve. The community’s dashboards, shared over the years,
have helped shape this design, and we would love to see how it works
with a wide variety of your homes. Even if you already have the perfect
dashboard built for your home, try it!

**Update:** We had a feedback form in the release notes in this spot, but that's closed now. Thanks for your input!

### Time for a new card!

It has been a while since we introduced a new card, but this release, we
thought it might be _**time**_ to add a new one! Thanks to [@mrdarrengriffin],
Home Assistant now features a [Clock card](/dashboards/clock/)!

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a dashboard with a large clock card on it, indicating the current time" src="/images/blog/2025-04/card-clock.png" />

Yeah, the card is "just" showing the current time, but it is a really nice
addition to our card collection. It might be a great card for dashboards
you are showing on things like a wall-mounted tablet!

The Clock card offers several customization options, including the ability to
adjust the clock size, timezone, display the seconds alongside the hours
and minutes, and the ability to choose between a 12-hour or 24-hour format.

For more details, check out the [Clock card documentation].

[@mrdarrengriffin]: https://github.com/mrdarrengriffin
[Clock card documentation]: /dashboards/clock/

## Voice

The _**["year of the voice"](/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/)**_ might be behind
us, but we keep improving the voice experience in Home Assistant! This release
brings several enhancements to make interacting with your smart home even better.

### Improved Voice Wizard

If you set up a Home Assistant voice assistant compatible device,
like the [Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition][pve],
you will be guided through setting up your voice assistant, and this experience
has been greatly improved in this release.

As our voice experience is offering more choices, including local options
like Speech-to-Phrase, we wanted to make sure you are able to make the right
choices for your use case.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Two screenshots showing the new voice wizard that guides you setting up the best possible voice experience" src="/images/blog/2025-04/voice-wizard.png" />

The wizard will now help you make a more informed decision based on your
language, desired functionality, and device capabilities, ensuring you get the
best experience with your voice assistant.

### Continued conversation with LLMs

Ever tried to have a conversation with your voice assistant that is hooked up to
an LLM like ChatGPT? It’s good fun. However, having to say _"Ok Nabu"_, whenever
you answer one of Assist’s questions can really slow things down.

This release introduces the ability to have a continued conversation with LLMs.
If the LLM returns with a question, we will detect that and keep the
conversation going, without the need for you to say _"Ok Nabu"_ again.

<lite-youtube videoid="KyAuzYe4vAw" videotitle="Continued conversation demo"></lite-youtube>

This is a great way to have a more natural conversation with your voice
assistants, and it works with all LLMs supported by Home Assistant.

### Starting conversations

During [Voice chapter 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6VvzDSI8RU&t=4750s),
we added the ability for Home Assistant [to call analog phones to start a
conversation](/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/#home-assistant-phones-home-analog-phones-are-back). As of this release, this
feature is now available for ESPHome-based voice assistants,
like the [Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition][pve]!

This is a fantastic feature, as it allows you to build your own automations that
can send out voice prompts from your voice assistant and listen for a response,
instead of you having to trigger the conversation by saying the wake word.

Imagine, for example, you have left the garage door open, and a few minutes
later, your assistant says:

> Hey, I noticed you left the garage door open, do you want me to close it for you?

You simply reply “yes” or “no,” and it handles the rest… 🤯 Or perhaps after a
long day at work, you return home, and your assistant greets you warmly:

> Welcome home, Frenck! Hope you had a great day. Want to hear the news or maybe enjoy some music?

JLo made a great demo video of this one, involving his oven and the assistant
asking if he wants to set a timer:

<lite-youtube videoid="dq7--T_pVNA" videotitle="Starting a conversation from the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition"></lite-youtube>

This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for voice-driven automations.
Currently, this capability is only available when using LLM integrations,
but we’re exploring more use cases where it would be helpful.

If you listen closely to the demo above, you’ll notice a brief pre-announce
sound just before the conversation starts. This little notification prevents
your assistant from startling anyone by suddenly speaking out of nowhere and
preventing a jump scare! 🫣

You could even use custom sounds based on the scenario—like a doorbell chime
for visitors or a train station-style jingle when your morning commute gets
delayed, giving you extra time to grab that coffee before heading out. ☕

## Onboarding with a Home Assistant Cloud backup

If you are a user of [Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa][cloud], it means
you can safely store a backup of your Home Assistant installation in the cloud
as part of your subscription. A really convenient service that ensures you always
have a secure and worry-free backup of your Home Assistant installation, no
matter what happens.

Now, let’s say something did happen, maybe a hardware failure, or maybe you
are migrating to a new [Home Assistant Green](/green/), as of this release, you can
directly restore your backup from the Home Assistant Cloud during the
onboarding process of your new Home Assistant installation.

This means you can get up and running with your new Home Assistant installation
in no time, with all your settings, automations, and integrations restored from
your backup.

### Integration quality scale achievements

One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our
[integration quality scale]. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure
integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible
user experience.

This release, we celebrate several {% term integrations %} that have improved
their quality scale:

- **4 integrations reached platinum** 🏆
  - [Azure Storage], thanks to [@zweckj]
  - [Fronius], thanks to [@farmio]
  - [IronOS], thanks to [@tr4nt0r]
  - [inComfort], thanks to [@jbouwh]

- **2 integrations reached silver** 🥈
  - [Roborock], thanks to [@Lash-L]
  - [Vodafone Station], thanks to [@chemelli74]

This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers. The
effort and dedication required to reach these quality levels is significant,
as it involves extensive testing, documentation, error handling, and often
complete rewrites of parts of the integration.

A big thank you to all the contributors involved! 👏

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- The [Home Assistant Yellow Zigbee/Thread chip](/yellow) and [Home Assistant ZBT-1](/connectzbt1)
  can now be updated directly through Home Assistant update entities.
  Nice [@puddly]!
- When viewing the details of an entity in the entity dialog, we now provide
  more context about where the entity originates. Like its device and the area
  it is in. This is a first step in sprinkling more context throughout our UI.
  Thanks, [@piitaya]!
- We now provide sensors about your [backups]! Providing you information
  on things like when your last backup ran. Thanks [@mib1185]!
- This one is interesting if you make Blueprints. The [device selector] now
  supports filtering by model ID. Thanks for this one [@karwosts]!
- We now support turning on/off TVs in [HomeKit], nice one [@bdraco]!
- Thanks to [@piitaya], we now support lawn mower devices in [Google Assistant]
  and [HomeKit]!
- Variables in automations & scripts have been greatly simplified and fixed by
  [@arturpragacz]. All variables are now accessible anywhere in the script or
  automation, greatly simplifying the use of variables. Amazing!
- We now support adding additional interactions to cards! The hold and
  double tap actions are now available through the UI. Thanks [@piitaya]!

## Templates

If you are a power user, you probably use {% term templates %} in your
automations, scripts, or maybe even your dashboard. This release has a few
additions to our template engine that you might find useful.

To start with, in the [template integration] the light and switch templates have
been migrated to support the new and modern YAML style. Thanks [@Petro31] for
this one!

More noteworthy is the addition of a series of new template functions to make
working with data a lot easier:

- [`combine`](/docs/configuration/templating/#combining-dictionaries) – Combine multiple dictionaries.
- [`difference`](/docs/configuration/templating/#find-elements-in-first-list-not-in-second-list) – Find elements present in one list but not another.
- [`flatten`](/docs/configuration/templating/#flatten-a-list-of-lists) – Flatten a list of lists into a single list.
- [`floor_entities`](/docs/configuration/templating/#floors) – Retrieve entities associated with a specific floor.
- [`intersect`](/docs/configuration/templating/#find-common-elements-between-lists) – Identify common elements between lists.
- [`md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512`](/docs/configuration/templating/#hashing) – Perform common hashing operations.
- [`shuffle`](/docs/configuration/templating/#shuffling) – Randomly shuffle items in a list.
- [`symmetric_difference`](/docs/configuration/templating/#find-elements-that-are-in-either-list-but-not-in-both) – Find items in either list but not in both.
- [`typeof`](/docs/configuration/templating/#determining-types) – Determine the type of a variable or object for debugging.
- [`union`](/docs/configuration/templating/#combine-all-unique-elements-from-two-lists) – Merge unique elements from two lists.

## Device hierarchy for energy management

This release, [@karwosts] has introduced an improvement to Home Assistant’s
energy management system—one that’s been highly requested by the community.

This means you can now create a **device hierarchy** within your energy
configuration, establishing parent-child relationships between devices.

For example, imagine having a breaker monitoring the total energy consumption
of a circuit, but also separately tracking individual devices connected to that
circuit. Previously, Home Assistant might double-count this usage. Now, it
understands these relationships and accurately shows the individual device
usage without duplication.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Sreenshot of the individual device usage graph taken from the energy dashboard" src="/images/blog/2025-04/energy-management-device-hierarchy.png" />

In this screenshot, the water heater is a child of the heat pump. Both report
energy usage separately, but the water heater’s consumption is also included in
the total reported by the heat pump. With device hierarchy enabled,
Home Assistant correctly shows the usage of each device.

Awesome addition there [@karwosts]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Automation & script variable scopes" %}

The `variables` action is no longer restricted to local scopes; it can now
update the value of a variable also in outer scopes. If the variable was not
previously defined, it will be created in the top-level (script run) scope.

```yaml
actions:
  - variables:
      x: 1
      y: 1
  - sequence:
    - variables:
        y: 2  # Updates y, which exists in the outer scope
        z: 2  # Since z is not defined yet, it is assigned in the top-level scope
  - action: persistent_notification.create
    data:
      message: "{{ x }}, {{ y }}, {{ z }}" # x=1, y=2, z=2
      # Note: previously, it would be: x=1, y=1, z undefined
```

If you have automations or scripts that use the same variable name in
different (previously isolated) scopes, you will need to update them: simply use
distinct variable names to prevent any conflicts.

([@arturpragacz] - [#141114])

[@arturpragacz]: https://github.com/arturpragacz
[#141114]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/141114

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Jewish Calendar" %}

Holiday sensor changes:

- In Israel, "Simchat Torah" is now "Shmini Atzeret, Simchat Torah"
- In Israel, the 30th of Shvat returns "Family Day, Rosh Chodesh"

Additionally, the `type_id` has been removed from the state attributes, use
the `type` if needed instead.

([@tsvi] - [#137247]) ([documentation](/integrations/jewish_calendar))

[@tsvi]: https://github.com/tsvi
[#137247]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/137247

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Persistent notifications" %}

Persistent notifications with `notification_id` `config_entry_reconfigure` are
no longer created when an integration fails to authenticate.
Automations [triggering on such persistent notifications](/integrations/persistent_notification/#automation)
will thus no longer work.

([@emontnemery] - [#140932]) ([documentation](/integrations/gpsd))

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#140932]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/140932

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Reolink" %}

The Reolink password is now limited to 31 characters. The latest versions of the
Reolink app and desktop client also have this 31-character limit. If you
configured your Reolink password years ago, it is possible it is longer than
31 characters. In that case you will get a reauthentication flow asking you to
change the password. Passwords longer than 31 characters can cause issues in the
latest Reolink API.
