Home Assistant 2025.11! 🎉

November is here, and we've been hard at work refining some of the main experiences that you interact with every day, and I think you're going to love what we've built.

My personal favorite this release? The brand new target picker. 🎯

It's one of those changes that seems simple on the surface, but makes such a huge difference in how you build automations. You can finally see exactly what you're targeting, with full context about which device an entity belongs to and which area it's in. No more guessing whether you're controlling the right ceiling light when you have three of them!

But that's just the beginning. We're continuing with the automation editor improvements, this time with a completely redesigned dialog for adding triggers, conditions, and actions. It's cleaner, easier to read, and sets the foundation for some really exciting stuff coming in future releases. 🤫

And speaking of making things clearer, you can now control exactly how entity names appear on your dashboard cards. Want to show just the entity name? The device name? The area? Or combine them? Even if you rename things, your dashboards will stay perfectly in sync. No more manual updates needed!

Oh, and energy dashboard fans will appreciate the new pie chart view for device energy, complete with totals displayed in the corner of every energy card. 🥧

Enjoy the release!

PS: Oh, and pssst... Don't tell anyone 🤫, but there might be something exciting being released on November 19th. [Hit the bell on this announced YouTube stream to not miss it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSRvso6cbf0). Stay tuned! 😀

## A brand new target picker

Have you ever been building an automation and wondered, "Wait, which ceiling light is this?" when you see three entities all named "Ceiling light"? Or tried to figure out how many lights you're actually controlling when you target an entire floor or area?

We've all been there. Until now, the target picker didn't show you the full picture. You couldn't see which device an entity belonged to or which area it was assigned to. And when you selected a floor or area as your target, you had no idea how many entities you were actually affecting. This uncertainty meant many of you stuck with targeting individual entities, even though larger targets (like areas and floors) can make your automations much more flexible.

The new target picker changes all that. Now you get full context for everything you're targeting, and you can see exactly how many entities will be affected by your action.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of a light action configuration with targets picked." src="/images/blog/2025-11/target-picker.png" />

Want to dig deeper? You can expand any floor, area, or device to see exactly which entities are included and where they're coming from.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the details of a target." src="/images/blog/2025-11/target-details.png" />

This makes it so much easier to build automations that scale with your home. When you target an area or floor, your automation automatically adapts as you add or remove devices. No more updating your automations every time you add a new light or sensor. Your automations just work, which is exactly how it should be.

## A brand new way to add triggers, conditions, and actions in your automations

It's no secret that we're currently working hard on making automations easier to create. After the release of the automation sidebar [two releases ago](/blog/2025/09/03/release-20259/#automation-editor-sidebar), we are now introducing a new dialog to add triggers, conditions, and actions.

The changes are purely cosmetic: the dialog is bigger, so the description of each block is simpler to read, with a two-pane layout to ease both navigation and block selection.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new dialog to add an action." src="/images/blog/2025-11/add-automation-dialog.png" />

The building blocks (which are used to perform more complex conditions or sequences of actions, such as repeating actions or branching out your sequence into multiple paths) have been moved into the main dialog on a second tab. There is now a single entry point to add something to an automation instead of two, greatly reducing the number of buttons in complex automations.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new dialog to add a building block to an action." src="/images/blog/2025-11/add-automation-dialog-blocks.png" />

As mentioned above, these changes are purely cosmetic, for now! But this new dialog is the foundation of what’s coming next, and we cannot wait to present that to you once it finally lands.

## Naming entities on your dashboard

A few releases ago, we gave the entity picker a big upgrade by adding more context so you could easily see where each entity belongs ([May 2025 release](/blog/2025/05/07/release-20255/#picking-entities)). In this release, we're bringing that same flexibility to your dashboards.

You can now choose how names appear on your cards: show the entity, device, area, floor, or even combine them. This gives you full control over how your dashboards look and feel. For example, in a dedicated section for a specific device, you might choose to display only the entity name to avoid repeating the device name on every card.

Of course, you can still set a custom name if you want complete control over the text shown.

And the best part? If you rename an entity or device, your dashboards will automatically stay in sync. No more manual edits needed; everything just updates itself.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the configuration dialog of a tile card." src="/images/blog/2025-11/card-naming.png" />

## Energy pie

We've added a new layout to the devices energy graph: "pie" 🥧. You can toggle between the regular bar chart and the new pie chart by clicking the icon in the top-right corner.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the devices energy graph in pie layout." src="/images/blog/2025-11/pie-chart.png" />

Doing this made the top-right corner of the other energy cards feel empty, so we used that space to display the total energy for the selected period. For example, if the date picker is set to today, the total solar energy for today will be displayed in the corner of the solar production graph card.

## Progress for Home Assistant and Add-on updates

With this release, you can now track the progress of updates to Home Assistant and Add-ons (managed by the Supervisor)! The progress includes the stages of downloading and unpacking, so the time required will vary based on your internet speed, CPU performance, and system load. As a result, the progress is not reflected as perfectly linear, but it does still provide a good estimate of how far along the update is.

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are no longer available as of this release:

- **Vultr** has been removed. The integration has not been working since the API v1 that it used was taken offline in September 2023.
- **IBM Watson IoT Platform** has been removed. On September 8, 2020, IBM announced the withdrawal of its support for the IBM Watson IoT Platform and successively discontinued all versions until September 30, 2022.
- **Plum Lightpad** has been removed. Their servers have been shut down, which made the integration non-functional.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:

- [@thecode] added [group] support for valves, so you can group multiple valves into one.
- Searching in data tables got a lot better; you can now search over multiple columns at once. Thanks [@wendevlin]!
- Energy graphs now show the total of the period in the top-right corner. Great addition, [@MindFreeze]!
- Thanks to [@karwosts], you can now use images from any integration providing images for your dashboard background.

### Improved logging efficiency

If you're using the Home Assistant Operating System, we have some great news for you! We've made our logging system way more efficient. 🚀

You might not realize it, but all those Home Assistant logs you can find in **Settings** > **System** > **Logs** were actually being stored on your disk twice. 🙈

Home Assistant OS keeps all logs for everything, including Home Assistant itself, in a very efficient way, even across restarts! But on top of that, we were also writing them to a log file in your Home Assistant configuration folder.

That's not ideal. It takes twice the disk space, but more importantly, it causes unnecessary wear on your storage medium, which means it will fail sooner. This is especially concerning if you're using an SD card in, for example, a Raspberry Pi.

As of this release, we've stopped writing logs to the configuration folder. You can still view and download all logs from the Home Assistant settings page, just like before. We've adapted that page to read the logs from the OS directly instead.

{% tip %}
Are you more into the command line? No worries, our Home Assistant CLI has you covered. Check it out by running `ha core logs --help` for more information.
{% endtip %}

### The new Home Dashboard keeps getting smarter

Following the improvements introduced in the latest releases, this release makes the experience even smoother and more intuitive.

We've simplified and reorganized things:

- Suggested entities and favorites are now combined into a single, smart section, showing you what's most relevant in one place.
- Areas are now grouped by floor, making it easier to browse and understand your home's layout at a glance.
- The Lights, Climate, and Security views have been moved to their own dedicated dashboards, so you can access them directly under **Settings** > **Dashboards**. These dashboards now also include devices that aren't assigned to any specific area, ensuring nothing is overlooked.

These improvements bring everything together more naturally, helping your Home Dashboard feel less like a setup and more like a true reflection of your home.

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes, it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

---

{% details "Set assumed state to group if at least one child has assumed state" %}

Previously, the group’s assumed state was always false, regardless of the state of its child entities.

This has now changed:

The group will now have an assumed state of `true` if at least one child entity has an assumed state.
This makes the group's assumed state reflect the uncertainty of its children more accurately.
These domains have been added: switch, fan, light, and cover.

([@piitaya] - [#154163]) ([group docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Asuswrt" %}

The `last_time_reachable` attribute has been removed from the `asuswrt` device tracker.
Use the `last_changed` attribute instead in your automations.

([@ollo69] - [#154219]) ([asuswrt docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "LG webOS TV" %}

The state of LG webOS TV media player entities that do not have an automation trigger to turn on the device will be set to `unavailable` instead of `off`.

([@thecode] - [#155164]) ([webostv docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Mealie" %}

The `mealie` integration now requires Mealie version 2 or later.

Mealie version 1 is no longer supported. Version 2 was released in October 2024, so over a year ago. Given the differences between versions 1 and 2, we are no longer able to support or test backward compatibility with version 1.

([@andrew-codechimp] - [#153203]) ([mealie docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Motion Blinds" %}

The tilt position of `motion_blinds` devices has been corrected to align with the Home Assistant standards.
The new tilt position will be: 0 = closed/covering the window opening, 100 = open/letting light through.
The previous tilt position can be converted to the new tilt position as follows:

- `new` = `100 - old`
- `current_tilt_position` = `100 -> 0`
- `current_tilt_position` = `75 -> 25`
- `current_tilt_position` = `50 -> 50`
- `current_tilt_position` = `25 -> 75`
- `current_tilt_position` = `0 -> 100`
- `open_cover_tilt` -> `close_cover_tilt`
- `close_cover_tilt` -> `open_cover_tilt`

Any automations concerning Motion Blinds devices that use the `current_tilt_position` attribute or use tilt open/close will need to be adjusted.

([@starkillerOG] - [#149777]) ([motion_blinds docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Mobile app" %}

The `mobile_app` integration, which supports the iPhone and Android companion apps, now handles zone-only updates better. When your companion app sends just the zone name (not the exact coordinates), the device tracker will show the zone's friendly name.

The `person` entity now shows the zone's friendly name (not its object ID) for custom zones. This might break existing automations that trigger on a person's state.

As an example, if you have a zone named `zone.kids_school` with the friendly name `School`:

- **Before** this change, the state of the corresponding `person` and `device_tracker` entities would be `kids_school` when the "Location Sent" in the companion app was set to send "Zone Name Only" and `School` when it was set to "Exact".
- **After** this change, the state of the corresponding `person` and `device_tracker` entities will be `School` for both the "Location Sent" settings in the companion app.

([@Ashus] - [#149453]) ([mobile_app docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nederlandse Spoorwegen" %}

The Nederlandse Spoorwegen entity is now displayed as a timestamp entity, rather than a string. Please adapt your automations and scripts.

([@joostlek] - [#154011]) ([nederlandse_spoorwegen docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ONVIF" %}

The `Speed` parameter in the ONVIF `GoToPreset` action is now optional.

The default of `0.5` is no longer set. If you want to restore the previous behavior you have to set `speed` to `0.5` in your action.

([@carlos-sarmiento] - [#149636]) ([onvif docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OralB" %}

In the OralB integration, states and attributes have changed.

In multiple places, spaces have been replaced with underscores: 

- Toothbrush state:

  - `flight menu` → `flight_menu`
  - `selection menu` → `selection_menu`
  - `final test` → `final_test`
  - `pcb test` → `pcb_test`
  
- Brushing mode:

  - `daily clean` → `daily_clean`
  - `gum care` → `gum_care`
  - `tongue cleaning` → `tongue_cleaning`
  - `super sensitive` → `super_sensitive`
  - `deep clean` → `deep_clean`

- Pressure:

  - `power button pressed` → `power_button_pressed`
  - `button pressed` → `button_pressed`

- Sector:

  - `no sector` → `no_sector`
  - `sector 1` → `sector_1`
  - `sector 2` → `sector_2`
  - `sector 3` → `sector_3`
  - `sector 4` → `sector_4`

Automations should be updated to use the new states and attributes.

([@tr4nt0r] - [#153605]) ([oralb docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Renault" %}

The discovery of Renault functionality was previously based on assumptions that may have created invalid and non-functional entities.
These will no longer be created.

([@epenet] - [#154137]) ([renault docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Traccar Server" %}

The Traccar integration has been updated to use a more secure API Token for authentication. This is a required, one-time breaking change to align with Traccar's security recommendations and ensure the integration continues to work.

This release migrates the integration away from the older username/password method, ensuring continued stability and security for all users while also allowing users with SSO-based setups to use the integration.

When you update Home Assistant, the existing Traccar integration will need to be re-authenticated:

1. Generate an API Token on your Traccar server (you'll find this option in your Traccar server's user settings).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & services** > **Traccar Server**.
3. Click "Reconfigure" and enter your new API Token when prompted.

Once you've done this, your Traccar devices and entities will work exactly as they did before.

([@pantherale0] - [#155297]) ([traccar_server docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Xbox" %}

The `Account tier` and `Gold tenure` sensors have been retired, as they no longer receive updates following the transition from Xbox Live Gold to Xbox Game Pass. Additionally, the `In party` and `In multiplayer` binary sensors have been removed, since they’ve been non-functional for quite some time.

([@tr4nt0r] - [#154891]) ([xbox docs])
