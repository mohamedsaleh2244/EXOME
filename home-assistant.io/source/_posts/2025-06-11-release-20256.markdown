Home Assistant 2025.6! 🎉

We are already half way through 2025, can you believe it? I personally can't, as it feels like we just started the year. Not just that, there are so many exciting things to still come this year, and I can't wait to share them with you!

Anyway, the June release is here! A week later than usual, but it also means we had an extra week to polish and beta test this release. Like the [previous release](/blog/2025/05/07/release-20255/), this release is packed with quality-of-life improvements!

Last release my favorite feature was the new entity picker; this release, we improved ALL other pickers! No surprise that this, again, makes it to my top favorite this release. Although the ability to group media players directly from the media player card is a close second. It is so nice to see how Home Assistant keeps getting better and better, and how our community keeps contributing to it. 😍

If you are leveraging Bluetooth in your Home Assistant setup, you will also love the new Bluetooth connection graph that shows how your Bluetooth devices are connected, including Bluetooth proxies. Troubleshooting Bluetooth has become so much easier now!

Enjoy the release!

_PS: We will pick up the regular release schedule again now, so expect the next release on the first Wednesday of July (July 2nd)._

## Improving all the "pickers"

Pickers are those dropdowns you use to select entities, devices, areas, and more. Pickers are *everywhere* in Home Assistant, being used in automations, scripts, and configuration options.

Last release, we [introduced a new entity picker](/blog/2025/05/07/release-20255/#picking-entities), which was a big hit! This release takes things further by refining the search experience based on your feedback.

Even better, that same improved search experience now comes to the area, category, floor, label, user, and device pickers too! They are consistent, fast, and easy to use, no matter what you're selecting.

And the device picker? It now has a fresh look to match, complete with manufacturer logos and styling inspired by the entity picker.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new device picker, including the area and integration that provides them." src="/images/blog/2025-06/new-device-picker.png" />

## Making sense of Bluetooth

Home Assistant has powerful [Bluetooth capabilities], and with the use of something like [ESPHome Bluetooth proxies], you can extend your Bluetooth network to cover your entire home. This release brings some improvements to the Bluetooth integration that will help you understand your Bluetooth network better.

The Bluetooth integration now provides a visualization that shows how your Bluetooth devices are connected to your Home Assistant instance, whether that's directly to your system or through a Bluetooth proxy.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showcasing the new Bluetooth connection graph; Even Bluetooth proxies are shown in the map." src="/images/blog/2025-06/bluetooth-connection-graph.png" />

It not only shows the actively connected devices, but also the devices that are in range, but not yet known to Home Assistant. This is a great way to see what devices are around you and where they can be potentially connected.

Oh! And now that the Bluetooth integration has a sleek new visualization, the [Zigbee integration], which already has a similar feature, has been given a visual update. This makes visualizations consistent across Home Assistant.

## Iterations of the experimental area dashboard

In the April release, we introduced a [new experimental Areas dashboard](/blog/2025/04/02/release-20254/#a-new-experimental-areas-dashboard), which automatically generates a ready-to-use dashboard based on the areas you’ve set up in your home. It uses sections and tile cards for a modern, clean, and intuitive look --- all built for you in a couple of clicks.

As this is experimental, it is being continuously iterated on. This release brings some nice changes, based on your feedback, to subtly refine the experience.

We added a new "Actions" section that includes scripts, automations, and scenes. We also added number entities (and number helpers), button entities (and button helpers), counters, and timer helpers to the "Others" section. This makes it easier to find and manage your automations and scenes in the context of your areas.

Finally, we renamed the "Entertainment" section to "Media players". This makes it clearer that this section is specifically for your players, and may not include your DIY arcade machine 👾.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new areas dashboard; showcasing the new Actions section." src="/images/blog/2025-06/areas-dashboard.png" />

## Deprecating installation methods and 32-bit architectures

This release introduces important deprecation announcements, and though they only affect a small percentage of users, it is important that they understand the impacts. We've written [a detailed blog](/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/) that explains the rationale, timeline, and tips on how to migrate --- which I highly suggest reading if you think you're affected.

- **Installation Methods**: The **Core** and **Supervised** installation methods are now officially deprecated. These are advanced setups that are only used by a small portion of users, as they involve running Home Assistant in a Python environment or installing the Supervisor on top of your own operating system. Moving forward, we are focusing our support on the more streamlined and maintainable installation methods: **Home Assistant OS** and **Home Assistant Container**.

- **32-bit Architectures**: Support for legacy 32-bit CPU architectures (**i386**, **armhf**, and **armv7**) is also being deprecated. These architectures are increasingly uncommon and pose challenges for maintaining compatibility and performance.

To assist you during this transition, Home Assistant will now raise a **repair issue** after upgrading if your system is affected by these deprecations. This notification will appear in the repair dashboard, providing information about the deprecation along with guidance on how to migrate to a supported setup.

It's important to note that while these methods and architectures are deprecated, they will continue to receive support for the next six months, until the release of Home Assistant 2025.12. You can continue to use them after this point, but we would highly recommend migrating. After this 6-month period, they will become unsupported, meaning they will no longer receive updates or official assistance.

If you don't receive this repair message, you're not affected. However, you can double-check using [our guide](/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#what-does-deprecated-and-unsupported-mean) if you'd like. We also have specific information on what becoming deprecated and unsupported [means for your installation](/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#what-does-deprecated-and-unsupported-mean). Lastly, we have detailed information on [how best to migrate](/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#how-to-migrate) to a supported system.

### Integration quality scale achievements

One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our
[integration quality scale]. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure
integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible
user experience.

This release, we celebrate several {% term integrations %} that have improved
their quality scale:

- **1 integration reached gold** 🥇
  - [SwitchBot], thanks to [@zerzhang]

- **1 integration reached silver** 🥈
  - [Shelly], thanks to [@bieniu]

This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers. The
effort and dedication required to reach these quality levels is significant,
as it involves extensive testing, documentation, error handling, and often
complete rewrites of parts of the integration.

A big thank you to all the contributors involved! 👏

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **RTSPtoWebRTC** has been removed as it has been replaced by the [go2rtc] integration.

[go2rtc]: /integrations/go2rtc

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:

- A small but neat one: [@balloob] made it so discoveries shown on an integration page are now sorted by title. Helpful!
- The [Home Assistant Cloud] integration will now raise a repair issue when your subscription has expired, helping make sure you’re aware and not caught off guard. Nice one, [@ludeeus]!
- More backup improvements! 🎉
  - Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if not all add-ons or folders were successfully backed up. Thanks, [@emontnemery]!
  - [@agners] made it so that when an add-on is auto-updated, a backup is now correctly created as an "add-on"-backup. Great!
  - A new automatic backup [event entity] has been added to track automatic backups made by the system. Great addition by [@mib1185]!
- [@lboue] added support for the [Matter] pump device type. Another one
  added to the list—awesome!
- The Template integration got a big boost!
  - [@Petro31] added modern-style YAML support for template fans, locks, alarm control panels, vacuums, and covers. So clean!
  - You can now create **trigger-based template covers**. Yep, also by [@Petro31]!
  - The `trigger_variables` option is now supported when using `for` in a trigger. A small but powerful feature. Thanks, [@Petro31]!
  - New template filters! You can now use `from_hex`, and `base64_encode` now supports both bytes and strings. Handy additions from [@Petro31]!
- New sensor capabilities:
  - [@Passific] added a new device class and units for **reactive energy**. Nice!
  - A new unit for **energy distance (Wh/km)** has been added. Thanks, [@frenck]!
  - Sensors now support **mg/m³** as a concentration unit—another nice addition by [@frenck]!
  - [@Arnie97] added support for **liters** as a unit for gas sensors. Much appreciated!
- The new `recorder.get_statistics` action lets you query statistics directly
  from the recorder. Powerful stuff, [@Hypfer]!

## Sidebar improvements

If you didn't know yet, you can actually adjust the contents of your Home&nbsp;Assistant sidebar. You can change the order and show/hide items by pressing and holding the "Home Assistant" text at the top of the sidebar, or by going to your user profile page and selecting "Change the order and hide items from the sidebar".

This release brings a couple of much-needed improvements to this feature. When you customize the sidebar, it will now bring up a nice and clean dialog that allows you to drag and drop items to change their order, or hide them by clicking the eye icon next to them.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new dialog that can be used to order or hide the items in the sidebar." src="/images/blog/2025-06/sidebar-customization.png" />

The biggest improvement is actually found somewhere else! Previously, the customization of the sidebar was only applied to the device you made the changes on; and even more annoying, sometimes it would lose the changes, or it would magically forget your settings on our [mobile companion apps] when you switched between your home network (and thus the internal URL). 🥲

In this release, this annoyance has been fixed! The sidebar customization is now stored in your user profile, so your personalized layout follows you across all devices you use with Home Assistant!

## Join/unjoin groups of media players

Media players in Home Assistant can provide actions for media players to join or unjoin a group of media players. This is a great way to dynamically control your media players and the groups they are in. However, this feature was somewhat limited, as it could only be used as actions within things like automations or scripts.

Now, [@AlexGustafsson] changed that! 🎉

You can now use the media player card to join or unjoin groups of media players. This is a great way to control your media players and their groups directly from the UI.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the media player card providing controls to group media player with the current used media player." src="/images/blog/2025-06/group-media-players-from-media-player-card.png" />

Please note that, you can only join or unjoin groups of media players that support this feature. Unfortunately, not all media players support this, so it might not be available for all your media players.

Anyhow, amazing contribution Alex! 👏

[@AlexGustafsson]: https://github.com/AlexGustafsson

## Reset/restore entity IDs

You can now restore the ID of an entity to its original value. This is useful if you have renamed an entity and want to revert it back to its original entity ID.

This feature is available in the entity configuration dialog, where you can now find a "Reset" icon on the entity ID field. When clicked, it will restore the entity ID to its original value. Additionally, there is the option called "Recreate entity IDs" in the top right three-dotted menu on the device page, to reset all entity IDs of a device to their original values.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the reset option of the entity ID in the entity configuration dialog." src="/images/blog/2025-06/reset-entity-id.png" />

## Patch releases

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Met Office" %}

Met Office [deprecated the Datapoint API](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/datapoint/datapoint-retirement-faqs) used by this integration, causing it to stop working. To address this, it is now migrated to [DataHub API](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/met-office-weather-datahub).

To keep using this integration, you will need to provide a new API key, which can be obtained by signing up for [DataHub](https://datahub.metoffice.gov.uk/) and subscribing to [Global spot dataset](https://datahub.metoffice.gov.uk/pricing/site-specific). The free subscription provides 360 calls per day, which is enough for this integration to work.

Some sensors have changed due to the new data source:

- Hourly forecast provided by the weather entity now has actual hourly entries as opposed to 3-hourly in the old version
- Instead of `visibility` and `visibility_distance` sensors showing a range and qualitative description (such as "1-4 km" and "Poor"), the integration now exposes a single `visibility` sensor with precise visibility distance in meters
- The integration no longer exposes "daily" and "3-hourly" sensors; there is a single set of them now
- The integration sensors no longer expose `Site ID`, `Site name` and `Sensor ID` attributes as these don't provide any additional value

{% enddetails %}

If you are a custom integration developer and want to learn about changes and
new features available for your integration: Be sure to follow our
[developer blog][devblog]. The following changes are the most notable for this release:

- [Icon translations now support ranges](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/05/22/range-based-icons/)
- [Sensor device classes now have default display precision](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/05/26/sensor-default-display-precision/)
