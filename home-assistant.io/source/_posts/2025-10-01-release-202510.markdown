Boo! 👻

We just [celebrated our birthday](/blog/2025/09/17/home-assistant-turns-12/) 🥳, which means it is time for spooky season; get ready for Halloween! And, hello to the October release of Home Assistant 2025.10! 🎃

This release iterates on some of the features we introduced in the last couple of releases, but also introduces some brand-new ones!

The highlight of this release is definitely the iterations of the automation editor, which gained a sidebar last release, and now has gained undo/redo functionality, a resizable sidebar, improved copy/paste, and more! Thanks for all the feedback you provided on the previous release; it made a massive difference in this release.

Using multiple wake words for voice assistants is now possible, which opens up a lot of possibilities, especially for dual-language households (like mine 😉). Dashboards get more intelligent by suggesting entities based on your usage patterns, and the AI Task can now generate images, which I'm curious to see what the community will do with it!

Enjoy the release!

## Automation editor

In the [last release](/blog/2025/09/03/release-20259/), we introduced a new layout for the automation editor, and your feedback has been invaluable in helping us refine it!

This release fixes a few of the most common issues we managed to gather from all of you. Thanks for all the feedback! ❤️

### The sidebar is resizable

Working on an action that is too complex for a small sidebar? Maybe one with a few YAML fields? You can now resize the sidebar to adapt the layout to your current task!

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the automation editor with the sidebar expanded on the right. The sidebar is larger in this screenshot, as it can now be resized." src="/images/blog/2025-10/automation-editor-resizable-sidebar.png" />

### CTRL+V

We previously introduced keyboard shortcuts to copy and cut.

Pasting was more complex to bring to life because you can paste a block (trigger, condition, action) in many different locations in your automation. In this release, we introduce a really simple pattern. If you previously copied a block, you can paste it below any block simply by selecting it and pressing CTRL+V.

Another very simple, but very welcome, quality-of-life improvement to the automation editor!

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screen recording showing how to copy and paste blocks in the automation editor; it especially highlights how a pasted block is pasted after the block you've selected." src="/images/blog/2025-10/automation-editor-copy-paste.gif" />

### The overflow menu is back

We initially relocated the overflow menu (the menu that appears when you click the `⋮`) with all the options related to a block on the sidebar, thinking this would make the flow cleaner.

Due to popular demand and helpful feedback that some actions were more difficult to reach (such as testing a condition or running an action), we decided to bring it back to the main section of the editor as well.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the automation editor with the overflow menu open on an item in the automation editor flow. This showcases all items are back, including disabling, copy, and pasting parts." src="/images/blog/2025-10/automation-editor-overflow-menu.png" />

### Undo/Redo

We've all been there: you're building a complex automation, make a mistake, and want to revert it, only to find out that it's really not simple. Up until now, the only way to revert some unsaved changes made to an automation was to close it and start over again… A very painful workflow.

This release introduces an Undo functionality (and its associated Redo). You can now undo up to 75 steps back in your automation editing history (and redo them if you want). Standard keyboard shortcuts (CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y) are also available! An amazing contribution from [@jpbede], thanks!

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screen recording showing how to undo and redo changes in the automation editor with the new back- and forward-arrows that are shown in the top right of the automation editor." src="/images/blog/2025-10/automation-editor-redo-undo.gif" />

### Repeat repeat repeat repeat

Finally, we noticed some unwanted complexity in our ["repeat" building block](/docs/scripts/#repeat-a-group-of-actions), which allows you to repeat one or multiple actions for as long as you need to.

This complexity stemmed from the fact that we were trying to cover four main use cases in a single block.

We decided to split this building block into four smaller ones, with simpler descriptions explaining each use case. Nice!

Here's how they were separated:

- **Repeat multiple times** - Repeat a sequence of actions a fixed number of times.
- **Repeat until** - Repeat a sequence of actions until a condition is satisfied. The condition is checked after each run of the sequence.
- **Repeat while** - Repeat a sequence of actions as long as a condition is satisfied. The condition is checked before each run of the sequence.
- **Repeat for each** - Repeat a sequence for each element of a list.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the repeat building block, now consisting of four distinct blocks for each use case." src="/images/blog/2025-10/automation-editor-split-repeat.png" />

{% note %}
For our advanced users: This evolution is only cosmetic. The YAML format of the repeat block does not change; this means your existing automations will not be affected by this change.
{% endnote %}

### Automation editor feedback

{% tip %}

One of Home Assistant's greatest strengths is our community. We're building this automation editor together, and your input will shape where it goes next. There are two ways to get involved:

- [Share your thoughts in our survey](https://forms.gle/ATWcTAj8bMbiGfUE7)
- [Join the conversation in the automations & scripts development channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1351529028112224359)

{% endtip %}

## AI Task - Draw me a sheep

In [2025.8](/blog/2025/08/06/release-20258/), we introduced [a way to generate data using the LLM of your choice](/blog/2025/08/06/release-20258/#integrate-ai-into-your-workflow-using-ai-task), paving the way to more AI-driven automations, dashboards, and other smart home interactions.

In this release, we introduce a way to generate images!

Now every time someone rings your doorbell, you can receive a notification with a cartoon version of the doorbell snapshot. [@JLo] has made this example a reality, and here's his demo with the associated automation!

## Dashboards get smarter - let your home suggest what to show

In the last release, we introduced the Home dashboard, offering a simpler way to control and monitor your smart home if you don’t have the time, energy, or need to customize your own dashboard in detail.

Now we’ve added a new concept: sections of suggested entities. This follows a basic algorithm that suggests entities you have interacted with the most in the past. It then shows these entities based on the hour of the day, with only relevant controls being suggested.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new prediction entities that are now put onto the experimental home dashboard. These are common entities you often interact with." src="/images/blog/2025-10/home-dashboard-prediction-entities.png" />

{% details "Adding prediction entities to any dashboard" %}

If you’re creating a manual dashboard with sections, you can integrate these prediction controls directly into it. The setup follows a section-based approach:

1. Add a new section.
2. Open and edit the YAML of that section.
3. Replace the entire section YAML with the following snippet:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: common-controls
  title: Common controls
```

{% enddetails %}

{% tip %}

One of Home Assistant's greatest strengths is our community. We're building this dashboard together, and your input will shape where it goes next. There are two ways to get involved:

- [Share your thoughts in our survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2pOf7WWNxmvcC8lH3NM5Ssf63y2pN3xP9HdlY09pr9goPqQ/viewform?usp=dialog)
- [Join the conversation in the dashboard development channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1351536906437005313)

## Voice

### Hello, hola

For a very long time, ESPHome-based voice assistants (even the tiny Atom Echo) secretly [supported multiple wake words](/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#3x-wake-words-and-2x-accuracy) under the hood. With this release, we're finally opening up this feature to you!

You can now define two wake words and two assistants for every voice assistant in your home!

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the device page of a Home Assistant Voice PE, showcasing the new entities for setting the second wake word and voice pipelines associated with it." src="/images/blog/2025-10/voice-2-wake-words.png" />

This makes it straightforward to support dual-language households by assigning different wake words to different languages. For example, _“Okay Nabu”_ could be used for French, while _“Hey Jarvis”_ is used for English.

Multiple wake words and assistants can be used for other purposes as well. Want to keep your local and cloud-based voice assistants separate? Easy! _“Okay Nabu”_ could be used for a cloud-based assistant while _“Hey Jarvis”_ is used for a local one.

We’d love to hear feedback on how you plan to use multiple wake words in your home!

### Beep boop

After a voice command, Assist responds with a short confirmation like _“Turned on the lights”_ or _“Brightness set”_. This lets you know that it understood your command and took the appropriate actions. However, if you’re in the same room as the voice assistant, this confirmation can feel redundant since you can see or hear that the appropriate actions were taken.

Starting with this release, Assist will detect if your voice command’s actions all took place within the same area as the satellite device. If so, a short confirmation “beep” will be played instead of the full verbal response. Besides being less verbose, this also serves as a quick reminder that your voice command only affected the current area.

{% note %}
This feature does not work for AI-enabled Assistants, as they can generate a wide variety of responses that can’t be replaced with a simple beep.
{% endnote %}

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:

- The "Logbook" has been renamed to "Activity" in the UI. This better reflects its purpose of showing a timeline of activities and events in your Home Assistant instance.
- [Matter] continues to expand with occupancy sensing hold time, climate running state for heat/cool fans, and thermostat outdoor temperature sensors! Great contributions from [@lboue] and [@virtualbitzz]!
- Lawn mower entities now support start mowing and dock intents for better voice control! Thanks, [@piitaya]!
- The [analog clock] we introduced last release got some more options! You can now enable a smooth motion for the seconds hand. Beautiful, [@timmo001]!
- Need the version of the [Home Assistant Mobile Companion App] you are using? If you have installed the latest versions of our apps, the version is now shown on the about page in the settings menu! Nice one, [@TimoPtr]!
- The [thermostat card] now supports [water heater entities]. Thanks, [@karwosts]!
- Thanks to [@cr7pt0gr4ph7], the add-on configuration UI has gotten support for more complex configurations; this means you will get a better experience when configuring add-ons with more complex options (like lists or user accounts). Well done!
- Talking about add-ons, we now include switch entities for those, making it easier to control your add-ons. Thanks, [@felipecrs]!
- Using a [webhook trigger] in your automation? You can now make it even more dynamic by using a template for the `webhook_id`. Thanks, [@RoboMagus]!
- We now have support for `MCF` (1000 Cubic Feet) as an alternate unit of measure for volume, thanks to [@ekobres], [@xtimmy86x] added `m/min` for speed sensors, and [@pioto] added `inH₂O` pressure unit support. Nice!

### New more information dialog for media player entities

This one, we have [@jpbede] and [@matthiasdebaat] to thank for! The 'more information' dialogs for media players have a revamped design, offering a cleaner and more intuitive interface.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new more information dialog when you click on a media player entity. It now features album art and great controls over your media player." src="/images/blog/2025-10/more-info-media-player.png" />

### Sync zooming charts in the history panel

When you have multiple charts in the history panel, zooming in on one chart will now automatically zoom in on all other charts as well. This makes it easier to compare data across different entities. Well done, [@birrejan]!

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screen recording showing the effect of all charts being in sync when scrolling or zooming. The recording shows how a change in one graph, affects all the others in the same way." src="/images/blog/2025-10/history-sync-zoom.gif" />

### Template & YAML editors get a toolbar

[@TCWORLD] has contributed a toolbar for the YAML and template code editors in our UI. This solves an issue where the previous floating button would float over the content of the editor and obscure it from view.

The new toolbar also includes undo and redo buttons, bringing [the same convenient undo and redo functionality](#undoredo) we introduced for the automation editor to these code editors as well. Plus, there's a nice little copy button to quickly copy your code! Nice!

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes, it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Targeting labels in automations and scripts" %}

Configuration and diagnostic entities with a label assigned to them will now be targeted/affected by service actions targeting that label. Previously, those entity categories were ignored on service action calls targeting labels.

If you have an automation or script with an action targeting a label, make sure that only entities that should be affected have that label assigned, even if they are config or diagnostic entities.

[#149309]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/149309
[labels docs]: /docs/organizing/labels/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HERE Travel Time" %}

HERE deprecated the previous free tier. The new Base Plan has 5000 free requests per month. The automatic update interval of the HERE Travel Time integration changed from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, so one route can be supported without costs.

([@eifinger] - [#147222]) ([here_travel_time docs])

[#147222]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/147222
[here_travel_time docs]: /integrations/here_travel_time/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Home Connect" %}

The Home Connect Alarm clock entity has been removed from the time platform, please use the number entity instead.

[#152188]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/152188
[home_connect docs]: /integrations/home_connect/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Shelly" %}

Removed previously deprecated extra attributes, please review your automations.

**Shelly Gas:**

- The Detected attribute of the Gas entity has been removed, the Gas detected entity should be used instead.
- The Self test attribute of the Operation entity has been removed, the Self test entity should be used instead.

**Shelly Air:**

- The Operational hours of the Lamp Life entity has been removed, if you still want that info please use a template entity.

([@chemelli74] - [#140386]) ([shelly docs])

[@chemelli74]: https://github.com/chemelli74
[#140386]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/140386
[shelly docs]: /integrations/shelly/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Slide Local" %}

The effect of the property "invert position" is extended from the position itself to the status (open or closed). With this adjustment, it is no longer necessary to use cover templates to invert the position to correct the status. If you have covers with inverted position and are using the state in automations, you must adjust the automations accordingly.

[#150418]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/150418
[slide_local docs]: /integrations/slide_local/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "SmartThings" %}

The `windFree` preset mode for the air conditioner has been renamed to `wind_free` to allow translation to happen. Please adapt automations accordingly.

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#152833]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/152833
[smartthings docs]: /integrations/smartthings/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Tibber" %}

Switch Tibber electricity pricing to 15-minute intervals.

- The `tibber.get_prices` action now returns 15-minute data instead of hourly.
- The `price_level` attribute is removed and no longer supported.
- The `intraday_price_ranking` attribute is now scaled to (0,1) to better support 15-minute prices.

[#151881]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/151881
[tibber docs]: /integrations/tibber/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Zabbix" %}

We removed official support for Zabbix 5.0 from the integration. While this does not directly break connections to Zabbix 5.0, future updates will not check for compatibility with this version. Note that Zabbix 5 LTS left its support window in May of 2025.

[@nolsto]: https://github.com/nolsto
[#149450]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/149450
[zabbix docs]: /integrations/zabbix/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ZHA" %}

Removes the extra ZHA specific cover entity attributes, their values were no longer populated.

- `target_lift_position`
- `target_tilt_position`

([@jeverley] - [#142534]) ([zha docs])

[@jeverley]: https://github.com/jeverley
[#142534]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/142534
[zha docs]: /integrations/zha/

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ZhongHong" %}

ZhongHong's climate entities `set_fan_mode` action behavior has changed.

The fan mode values are now converted to lowercase instead of uppercase to ensure compliance with the standard convention.

If you have automations relying on uppercase fan mode values, you will need to update them to use lowercase values instead.

([@Blear] - [#151559]) ([zhong_hong docs])

[@Blear]: https://github.com/Blear
[#151559]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/151559
[zhong_hong docs]: /integrations/zhong_hong/

{% enddetails %}

new features available for your integration: Be sure to follow our
