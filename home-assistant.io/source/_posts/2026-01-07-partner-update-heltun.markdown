Last month – and indeed last year! – we published a [blog recapping the highlights](/blog/2025/12/09/wwha-2025-recap/) from the Works with Home Assistant program in 2025. As with any certification program, our partnerships evolve: some start anew, some grow bigger and stronger, and some naturally run their course. In the interest of visibility for our community, we want to share an update about one such change. When a partner leaves the program, we believe it’s important to document this openly so you get the full picture.

## Why we’re making a change

Despite reaching out to HELTUN multiple times during 2025 to discuss renewing their Works with Home Assistant contract with the Open Home Foundation, we haven’t been able to connect. As their previous contract has now lapsed, we’re formally removing HELTUN from the Works with Home Assistant program.

We have no specific issues with the HELTUN devices, and hope they will continue to be compatible with Home Assistant – as Z-Wave devices operate on an open standard, they should continue to function. However, without a contract, HELTUN has no formal obligation to provide ongoing support, such as firmware updates via Z-Wave JS.

This is an example of why the contract is more than just paperwork. It’s intrinsic to the badging as it outlines, in a legal and binding document, our partners’ commitment to the community, keeping devices working long-term, and the values we all care about. Without it, we can’t maintain certification.

## What happens now

HELTUN’s integration page will now be removed from the partner filter, and an update has been published on our original HELTUN launch blog stating that the information is no longer applicable. They are now also prohibited from using the Works with badge on relevant marketing materials.

As we have no problems with the devices themselves, we will be happy to welcome HELTUN back into the program should they wish to re-engage in the future.

## Looking ahead

In more positive news, don’t forget we’ve introduced an [up-to-date list](https://works-with.home-assistant.io/certified-products/) of all certified devices from our current Works with partners to help guide your purchasing decisions – and watch this space for details of more brands joining us in 2026!
