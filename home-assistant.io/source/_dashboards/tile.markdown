The tile card gives you a quick overview of an {% term entity %}. The card allows you to add tap actions, and features to control the entity. You can also select the {% term entity %} to open the more info dialog. A badge is shown for some {% term entities %} like the [climate](/integrations/climate) or [person](/integrations/person) {% term entities %}.

  The circular background behind an icon indicates that there is a tap action.
  The "Downstairs" and "Upstairs" climate entities have a badge and a feature that is bottom-aligned.
