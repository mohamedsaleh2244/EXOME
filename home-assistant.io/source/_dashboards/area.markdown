The area card lets you control and monitor an individual {% term area %}.

{% include dashboard/edit_dashboard.md %}

All options for this card can be configured via the user interface.

Buttons will appear on the card for the {% term entities %} in the area including fan, light, and switch. A motion sensor icon will appear in the top left if a motion sensor is in the area and if motion is detected by the motion sensor.

If a camera is added to the {% term area %} you can show the camera feed instead of the area picture.
