This page contains only irrelevant and unhelpful information about Home Assistant. If you are going to prepare a talk about Home Assistant, perhaps some information mentioned here can be used for the intro.

## Name

Isn't it obvious? Home Assistant is the good soul that is assisting you in your home. The abbreviation `hass` (not to be confused with the German word "Hass", it's more like the abbreviation of **H**ome **A**ssistant **S**erver **S**ervice) was commonly used in the past, though it's now recommended to use the full name "Home Assistant" in documentation.

## Website

The website [https://www.home-assistant.io](/) was launched on December 18, 2014 and contains documentation about the setup process, the platforms and integrations, and for the developers.

## Logo

The logo was refreshed in 2023 for Home Assistant's 10th birthday. You can find more details in the [blog post](/blog/2023/09/17/a-refreshed-logo-for-home-assistant/).

## License

Home Assistant is open source software and available under the [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license.

## Hardware
