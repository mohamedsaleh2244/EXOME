The **Roborock** {% term integration %} allows you to connect your [Roborock](https://us.roborock.com/pages/robot-vacuum-cleaner) robotic vacuums to your Home Assistant. Roborock vacuums are
intelligent home cleaning robots and, depending on the specific device, may have features
like mopping capabilities, laser navigation, and options for changing cleaning
performance or location in the home. This integration enables you to control and
monitor your Roborock vacuum directly from Home Assistant.

The integration also allows for automation and integration with other smart home
devices. For example, you could send a notification when the vacuum is stuck, or
pause the vacuum when a media player starts playing music.

## Note about compatibility

The newly released [Q-Series](https://us.roborock.com/pages/roborock-store#Q-Series) devices are not supported. Roborock has changed the protocol for how these devices interact. It is unclear if new devices not in the Q-series will use the existing protocol or the new protocol. Most Q-Series devices should have partial support via the [Matter](/integrations/matter/) integration.

## Prerequisites

1. Download the Roborock App for iOS or Android.
2. Create an account and log in.
3. Add your Roborock device to the Roborock App (for example, by scanning a QR code).

## Data Updates

This integration uses both local and cloud {% term polling %} and also receives
cloud push events using MQTT. Local communication is preferred when possible.
Map data and routines are always fetched through the cloud, and Dyad and Zeo devices are cloud only.

The integration will automatically discover your Roborock devices using the cloud APIs and get
the needed information to communicate locally with them, if supported. Please ensure your Home Assistant
instance can communicate with the local IP of your device. We recommend setting a static IP
for your Roborock Vacuum to help prevent future issues. The device communicates on port 58867.
Depending on your firewall, you may need to allow communication from Home Assistant to your vacuum on that port.


## Supported functionality

Roborock devices have a variety of features that are supported on some devices but not on others. Only entities that your device supports will be added to your integration.

In addition, some vacuums allow routines to be set up in the app. For each of those routines, a button entity will be created, allowing you to trigger it.

#### Actions

##### Action Set Vacuum Goto Position

The `roborock.set_vacuum_goto_position` action will set the vacuum to go to
the specified coordinates.

- **Data attribute**: `entity_id`
  - **Description**: Only act on a specific robot.
  - **Optional**: No.
- **Data attribute**: `x`
  - **Description**: X-coordinate, integer value. The dock is located at x-coordinate 25500.

##### Action Get Vacuum Current Position

The `roborock.get_vacuum_current_position` action will get the current position of the vacuum. This
is a cloud call and should only be used for diagnostics. This is not meant to be used for
automations. Frequent requests can lead to rate limiting. 

- **Data attribute**: `entity_id`
  - **Description**: Only act on a specific robot.
  - **Optional**: No.

Example:

```yaml
action: roborock.get_vacuum_current_position
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.roborock_s7
data: {}
```

- **Result**: You will get a response like this:

  ```yaml
  vacuum.roborock_s7:
    x: 28081
    y: 25168
  ```

##### Action Get Maps

The `roborock.get_maps` action will return the maps available on the device and
details about any named rooms on each map.

- **Data attribute**: `entity_id`
  - **Description**: Get maps for a specific device
  - **Optional**: No.

This will return the name of the map, and the room names and id numbers. See [How can I clean a specific room? ](#how-can-i-clean-a-specific-room) for more details on how to use the maps response.

### Dyad devices

## FAQ

### Can I use the Mi home app with this integration?
No. This integration requires information from your Roborock app to set up and uses Roborock's protocols to communicate with your device. You must have your vacuum synced to the Roborock app.

### Can I block internet access for this device?
As of right now - no. When the vacuum is disconnected from the internet, it will attempt to disconnect itself from Wi-Fi and reconnect itself until it can reach the Roborock servers.

### What devices are supported?
If you can add your device to the Roborock app - it is supported. However, some older vacuums like the Roborock S5 must be connected using the Mi Home app and can be set up in Home Assistant through the [Xiaomi Miio](/integrations/xiaomi_miio/) integration.

### What features will you support?
We are working on adding a lot of features to the core integration. We have reverse-engineered over [100 commands](https://python-roborock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_commands.html). The documentation is currently very bare-bones, and we are looking for users to help us make it more complete. The following are some of the functionalities we plan to add to Home Assistant Core. We ask that you are patient with us as we add them.
- Selective room cleaning
- Dock controls
- Manual vacuum remote control
- Status information such as errors, clean time, consumables, etc.
- Viewing the camera
- Viewing the map

### How can I clean a specific room?
We plan to make the process simpler in the future, but for now, it is a multi-step process.
1. Make sure to first name the rooms in the Roborock app; otherwise, they won't appear in the debug log.
2. Go to {% my developer_call_service service="roborock.get_maps" title="**Developer Tools** > **Actions** > **Roborock: Get Maps**" %}. Select your vacuum as the entity. Note that room IDs and names are only updated on the currently selected map.

   - **Request**: Your request should look like:

      ```yaml
      action: roborock.get_maps
      target:
        entity_id: vacuum.s7_roborock
      ```

   - **Result**: You will get a response like this:

      ```json
      vacuum.s7_roborock:
        maps:
          - flag: 0
            name: Downstairs
            rooms:
              "16": Kitchen
              "17": Living room
      ```

3. Go back to {% my developer_call_service service="vacuum.send_command" title="**Developer Tools** > **Actions** > **Vacuum: Send Command**" %} then type `app_segment_clean` as your command and `segments` with a list of the 2-digit IDs you want to clean. Then, add `repeat` with a number (ranging from 1 to 3) to determine how many times you want to clean these areas.

Example:

```yaml
action: vacuum.send_command
data:
  command: app_segment_clean
  params:
    - segments:
        - 22
        - 23
      repeat: 2
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.s7_roborock

```

## Troubleshooting

### I get a invalid or no user agreement error - but nothing shows up in my app

Roborock servers require accepting a user agreement before using the API, which may block Home Assistant during setup. Additionally, the Roborock may ask you to re-enter the user agreement, even if you have entered it before.  To allow Home Assistant to use the Roborock API, you need to take the following steps:
1. Open your Roborock app.
2. Open **Profile** > **About Us** > **User Agreement & Privacy Policy**.
3. Hit **Revoke authorization**.
4. Log back in and accept the policy.
5. Reload the Roborock integration!

### The integration tells me it cannot reach my vacuum and is using the cloud API and that this is not supported or I am having any networking issues

This integration has the capability to control your devices through the cloud API and the local API. If the local API is not reachable, it will just use the cloud API. We recommend only using the local API as it helps prevent any kind of rate-limiting.

The steps needed to fix this issue are specific to your networking setup. Here are some general troubleshooting steps:

1. Ensure your vacuum can communicate externally via port 8883.
2. Ensure your vacuum can communicate with your Home Assistant instance on ports TCP 58867 and UDP 58866.
3. If you are using a tool such as Pi-Hole, AdGuard, or anything else that modifies your DNS, ensure that your vacuum is exempted.
4. Set a static IP for your vacuum.
5. Check your router's webpage. If the device is losing connection, you need to focus on increasing your Wi-Fi network's performance.

### My Device goes unavailable every night at around 3am - how can I fix this?

Every night, the vacuum disconnects from the internet for about one minute and automatically reconnects. This causes the integration to go unavailable until the vacuum is reachable again. This is not an issue with the integration but rather the integration is reacting to the device's status.

### The integration tells me no devices were found even though I have devices on my account.

Some devices are not supported yet as they use a different protocol than other devices. Make sure you are on the latest version of Home Assistant.

### I'm getting information about rate limiting in my logs - what should I do?

There is rate limiting built into the Python package that this integration is built on. This is to try to help prevent your instance from overwhelming the Roborock servers and resulting in any kind of IP ban. Best practice is to disable the integration for 24 hours. 

It's also important to try to determine what caused this error in your setup. A common cause some users have is that they have a script that automatically reloads the integration if it goes unavailable. Then, if the device gets stuck and runs out of battery, you are frequently reloading and that causes rate limits.
