The **Control4** {% term integration %} allows you to control and monitor lights, Room Media, and climate devices from your local Control4 system. Your Control4 controller must be running OS 3.0+.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up, you should assign a static IP address/DHCP reservation on your router to your Control4 controller. Home Assistant must be able to communicate with the controller over the local network; 4Sight remote access is not supported.

The username and password required for this integration are the same credentials you use to log in to the Control4 site at [https://my.control4.com/](https://my.control4.com/).
