The **SwitchBot Bluetooth** {% term integration %} allows you to control SwitchBot [devices](https://www.switch-bot.com/) such as sensors, locks, shades, lights, plugs, robot vacuums, hubs and etc.

## How you can use this integration

The SwitchBot integration lets you do many things, such as switching devices on and off, changing device modes, monitoring sensor data and energy usage in the Home Assistant dashboards, and controlling device configurations manually or via automations.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this integration, it is required to have working [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) set up on the device running Home Assistant. A [SwitchBot Hub](https://switch-bot.com/pages/switchbot-hub-mini) is not required for this integration.

If you have multiple devices of the same type, you need to get the BTLE MAC address of your device to tell your devices apart. You can find the address for your device using the following steps:

1. Open the SwitchBot app.
2. Open device settings.
3. Click on "Device Info".
4. Write down the BTLE MAC address of your device.

Please note, device names configured in the SwitchBot app are not transferred into Home Assistant.

Some SwitchBot devices need to be configured within the app before being controlled by Home Assistant, such as calibrating the cover open/close limits or pairing two covers to move together.

### Add mode

Before adding SwitchBot devices over Bluetooth, confirm whether your Bluetooth adapter is set to **Active** or **Passive** mode in the Bluetooth integration configuration.

- To open the Bluetooth integration settings, go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & services**" %} and select **Integrations**, then find and open the **Bluetooth** integration to check the adapter mode.

- Active mode
  - Devices are normally discovered automatically.
  - If a device is not discovered automatically:
    - For devices with a physical button, press and hold the button to enter pairing mode.
    - For devices without a button, power-cycle the device to trigger pairing mode.
    - If the device still cannot be discovered, try syncing devices from your SwitchBot account by selecting  the **SwitchBot** integration and signing in.

- Passive mode
  - Devices cannot be discovered via local Bluetooth scanning and must be synchronized through your SwitchBot account.
  - To sync devices from your account, go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & services**" %}, open **Integrations**, select **SwitchBot**, select  the integration to open the login window, and sign in. If the local Bluetooth scan detects devices that are linked to your SwitchBot account and within range, you can add them after signing in.

If you still cannot add a device, make sure it is powered on, within Bluetooth range, and not connected to another app. If necessary, follow the manufacturer's reset instructions or consult SwitchBot support.

### Adding encrypted SwitchBot devices

Some types of the SwitchBot devices are encrypted for improved security. More types and models will be added as encrypted devices in the future.

An encrypted SwitchBot device can be set up in Home Assistant in two different ways.
You can enter the key ID and encryption key yourself, or Home Assistant can import them from your SwitchBot account.

#### SwitchBot account (recommended)

Using this option you can provide your SwitchBot account login credentials and Home Assistant will import the appropriate encryption key from your account.

{% configuration_basic %}
Username:
  description: SwitchBot account username
Password:
  description: SwitchBot account password
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

{% important %}
This integration doesn't support SSO accounts (Login with Google, etc.) only username and password accounts.
{% endimportant %}

#### Enter the lock encryption key manually

This option is for those that would rather obtain the encryption key themselves, and/or want to know exactly where and how are their account credentials used.

{% configuration_basic %}
Key ID:
  description: Locks' encryption key ID
Encryption key:
  description: Locks' encryption key
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

For instructions on how to obtain the encryption key, see README in [PySwitchbot](https://github.com/Danielhiversen/pySwitchbot#obtaining-locks-encryption-key) project.

### Cover

Cover entities are added for Curtain, Curtain 3, Blind Tilt, Roller Shade, and Garage Door Opener.

#### Curtain

Features:

- open/close/pause
- set position
- get position
- get light level
- get battery level
- get calibration state

#### Curtain 3

Features:

- open/close/pause
- set position

- get light level
- get battery level
- get calibration state

#### Blind Tilt

Features:

- close up/close down/pause
- set position
- get position
- get light level
- get battery level
- get calibration state

The blind tilt is exposed as a cover entity with control of the tilt position only:

| Tilt Position | Blind State |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| 100%          | Closed Up   |
| 50%           | Fully Open  |
| 0%            | Closed Down |

The close button will close the blinds to the closest closed position (either 0% or 100%), and defaults to closing down if the blinds are fully open. Because Home Assistant believes 100% is open, the default cards will disable the open button when the tilt is at 100%, but the action will still work and open the blind to 50%.

##### Simple cover template entity

Some integrations may expose your SwitchBot Blind Tilt to other actions which expect that 100% is open and 0% is fully closed. Using a [Cover Template](/integrations/template/#cover), a proxy entity can be created which will be open at 100% and closed at 0%. This template entity is limited to closing in one direction.

{% raw %}

## Data updates

SwitchBot devices utilize a [​​local push](/blog/2016/02/12/classifying-the-internet-of-things/#classifiers)​​ strategy to maintain real-time status updates. When devices detect state changes, they actively push updates to Home Assistant for immediate synchronization. For user-initiated actions through Home Assistant (for example, when turning a device on/off), the integration performs an additional proactive status fetch to ensure instant confirmation of the new state.
The integration connects locally to the devices without going via the SwitchBot Cloud.

## Known limitations

### Slow connection times

Move the device closer, or replace the Bluetooth adapter with a faster one. See [Improving connection times](/integrations/bluetooth/#improving-connection-times) for more information.

### Device names not synced

Device names configured in the SwitchBot app are not transferred into Home Assistant.

### Battery level

Due to firmware limitations, early models such as **Lock** and **Lock Lite** report the battery level in coarse ranges rather than an exact value:

- < 10 %  → 10  
- 10 % – 20 % → 20  
- 20 % – 60 % → 60  
- ≥ 60 % → 100

Refer to the latest version of the [OpenAPI doc](https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/SwitchBotAPI) for precise definitions.

### Lock state

The integration currently only uses the primary lock state; in dual lock mode, not all things might work properly.

### Vacuum state

For robot vacuum K10+ and K10+ Pro, due to firmware implementation, it only returns these states, `cleaning` and `docked`

## Troubleshooting

The SwitchBot integration will automatically discover devices once the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is enabled and functional.

{% details "Config flow could not be loaded" %}
Possible custom integration conflict, using a different version of PySwitchbot; Try uninstalling the custom integration.
{% enddetails %}

{% details "No unconfigured devices found" %}
Make sure your devices are powered on and are in range.
{% enddetails %}

## Examples

### Automation ideas

You can create all sort of automations using sensors as triggers and switches, shades, and lights as actions.

- Turn on or turn off lights and switches when motion is detected.
- Turn on or turn off the Bot to control a fan, AC remote, or circulator when temperature or humidity are too low.
- Close the curtain when the temperature is too high.
- Turn off Relay Switch when power consumption is too high.
- Change the color of LED Strip Lights or Color Bulb or turn on the circulator using Bot or Relay Switch if carbon dioxide is too high.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
