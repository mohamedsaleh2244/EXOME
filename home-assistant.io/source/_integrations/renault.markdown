The **Renault** {% term integration %} offers integration with the **MyRenault** cloud service and provides sensors such as charger state and temperature.

This integration provides the following platforms:

- Binary sensors - such as plug and charge status.
- Device tracker - to track location of your car.
- Buttons - to start air conditioning or start/stop the charge. Please note that although available these actions do not work on all vehicles.
- Selectors - to change the charge mode.
- Sensors - such as battery level, outside temperature, odometer, estimated range, charging rate, and tyre pressure.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% configuration_basic %}
Locale:
  description: "The country code (e.g., `fr_FR`, `en_GB`) used to connect to the Renault servers. This should match your MyRenault account's locale setting."
Username:
  description: "The username used to connect to the Renault servers."
Password:
  description: "The password used to connect to the Renault servers."
Kamereon account id:
  description: "The Kamereon account ID that your vehicles are assigned to. If there is only one account available it will be automatically selected."
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

All vehicles linked to the account should then get added as devices, with sensors added as linked entity.

In some situations, some of the features may require a subscription such as the *Pack EV Remote Control* and/or the *Pack Smart Navigation* subscription.

## Data updates

Due to rate limitations from the Renault servers, the integration limits {% term polling %} to 60 data requests/hour.
For a single vehicle with all 7 endpoints available, the integration fetches data from the device every 7 minutes.

## Actions

### Action: Start A/C

The `renault.ac_start` action starts A/C on a vehicle.

  | Data attribute | Required | Description | Example |
  | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
  | `vehicle`| yes | device_id of the vehicle | |
  | `temperature` | yes | Target A/C temperature in °C | |
  | `when` | no | Timestamp for the start of the A/C (optional - defaults to now) | `2020-05-01T17:45:00` |

### Action: Cancel A/C

The `renault.ac_cancel` action cancels A/C on a vehicle.

  | Data attribute | Required | Description |
  | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `vehicle`| yes | device_id of the vehicle |

### Action: Set A/C schedules

The `renault.ac_set_schedules` action updates A/C schedules on a vehicle.

  | Data attribute | Required | Description | Example |
  | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
  | `vehicle`| yes | device_id of the vehicle | |
  | `schedules` | yes | Schedule details. Can be a single schedule or a list of schedules | see [example below](#ac_schedule_example) |

Notes:

- `schedules` can contain one or more schedules which are set within the same call.
- The `id` is compulsory on each `schedule` (should be 1 to 5, depending on the vehicle).
- The `activated` flag is an optional boolean. If it is not provided, then the existing flag will be kept as is.
- The `monday` to `sunday` elements are optional. If they are not provided, then the existing settings will be kept for each day. If they are provided as None, then the existing setting will be cleared. If a value is provided, it must contain the key `readyAtTime` (in UTC format).

<a name="ac_schedule_example">Example</a>:

```yaml
- id: 1 
  activated: true 
  monday: 
    readyAtTime: 'T12:00Z' 
- id: 2 
  activated: false 
  monday:
    readyAtTime: 'T12:00Z' 
  tuesday:
    readyAtTime: 'T12:00Z'
```

### Action: Set charge schedules

The `renault.charge_set_schedules` action updates charge schedules on a vehicle.

  | Data attribute | Required | Description | Example |
  | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
  | `vehicle`| yes | device_id of the vehicle |
  | `schedules` | yes | Schedule details. Can be a single schedule or a list of schedules | see [example below](#schedule_example) |
  
Notes:

- `schedules` can contain one or more schedules which are set within the same call
- the `id` is compulsory on each `schedule` (should be 1 to 5 depending on the vehicle)
- the `activated` flag is an optional boolean. If it is not provided, then the existing flag will be kept as is.
- the `monday` to `sunday` elements are optional. If they are not provided, then the existing settings will be kept for each day. If they are provided as None, then the existing setting will be cleared. If a value is provided, it must contain the keys `startTime` (in UTC format) and `duration` (in minutes).

<a name="schedule_example">Example</a>:

```yaml
- id: 1 
  activated: true 
  monday: 
    startTime: 'T12:00Z'
    duration: 15 
- id: 1 
  activated: false 
  monday: 
    startTime: 'T12:00Z'
    duration: 15 
```

## Known limitations

- Some of the features may require a subscription such as the *Pack EV Remote Control* and/or the *Pack Smart Navigation* subscription.
- Newer vehicles use new endpoints for some actions, which are not yet supported by the underlying library. The corresponding actions will currently fail with error code `err.func.wired.forbidden`.

## Troubleshooting

The **Renault** integration relies on:

- A stable internet connection.
- Renault server availability (unexpected downtime or scheduled maintenance).

You can quickly verify service status by opening the official Android/iOS app.

In any case, when reporting an issue, please enable [debug logging](/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#debug-logs-and-diagnostics), restart the integration, and as soon as the issue reoccurs, stop the debug logging again (*download of debug log file will start automatically*). Further, if still possible, please also download the [diagnostics](/integrations/diagnostics) data. If you have collected the debug log and the diagnostics data, provide them with the issue report.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
