The [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) {% term integration %} allows you to use the OpenRouter API as a conversation agent in Home Assistant.

This integration provides a way to interact with a wide range of AI models available on OpenRouter, while billing is handled by OpenRouter.
You can even use your own third-party (like OpenAI) API key.
