The **Jellyfin** {% term integration %} exposes a [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) server as a media source in Home Assistant.
Support is currently limited to music, movie and TV show libraries only. Other libraries will not appear in the media browser. This integration has been tested with Jellyfin server version 10.6.4 and later.

Additionally, this integration sets up every media session connected to the Jellyfin
server as a media player in Home Assistant to provide media controls for each session.

Browsing media inside Home Assistant in a player's context provides all libraries
of type Movie and Series.

This integration also creates a `Remote` entity for sending [remote commands](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/master/MediaBrowser.Model/Session/GeneralCommandType.cs) to the client, if supported. For example, this can be used to tell the client to navigate right twice, down once, and select the focused item:

```yaml
jellyfin_remote_script:
  alias: "Jellyfin Remote Script"
  sequence:
    - action: remote.send_command
      target:
        entity_id: remote.jellyfin_client
      data:
        delay_secs: 1.5
        command:
          - MoveRight
          - MoveRight
          - MoveDown
          - Select
```

## Actions

### Action browse media

You can use the `media_player.browse_media` action to step through your Jellyfin library to find media you want to play.

| Data attribute        | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`           | `entity_id` of the media player                                         |
| `media_content_id`    | **(optional)** Unique identifier of the content you want to browse into |

To start your browsing you don't set `media_content_id` to browse the root node.

#### Examples:
```yaml
action: media_player.browse_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.jellyfin
data:
  media_content_id: a656b907eb3a73532e40e44b968d0225

### Action search media

You can use the `media_player.search_media` action to find media you want to play.

| Data attribute        | Description                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

| `search_query`        | The search term                                   |

#### Examples:

```yaml

    - media_player.jellyfin
data:
  search_query: star
```
#### Response
```yaml

### Action play media

To play media on any player you first need to find the `media_content_id` of the content you want to play, through either [browsing to the media](#action-browse-media) or [searching media](#action-search-media).

| Data attribute        | Description                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`           | `entity_id` of the media player                   |
| `media_content_id`    | Unique identifier of the content you want to play |
| `media_content_type`  | `movie` or `tvshow`                               |

#### Examples:

Play a movie on one of the Jellyfin clients that supports playback.

```yaml
action: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id:
    - media_player.jellyfin
data:
  media_content_id: a982a31451450daeda02c89952e6d7cf
  media_content_type: movie
```
