[HELTUN](https://www.heltun.com/) thermostats make it easy to automate your heating system, their touch panel switches control your lighting and motorized appliances and their high load switches control any high load appliances like groups of lights, heaters, or individual sockets.

### Firmware updates

HELTUN periodically releases new firmware with additional features and functionality which can be sent to devices via an encrypted OTA (Over-The-Air) update process. In Home Assistant, you can navigate to your device page and use the Update Device Firmware option to upload the firmware from HELTUN for your device.
