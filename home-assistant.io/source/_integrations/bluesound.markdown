The **Bluesound** {% term integration %} allows you to control your [Bluesound](https://www.bluesound.com/) HiFi wireless speakers and audio integrations from Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Buttons

These are the available button entities:

- `button.speaker_name_set_sleep_timer`: Setting a sleep timer.
- `button.speaker_name_sleep_timer`: Clearing the sleep timer.

Replace `speaker_name` with the name of your speaker.

### Button `button.speaker_name_set_sleep_timer`

Sets a timer that will turn off the speaker. For each time you call this it will increase the time by one step. The steps are (in minutes): 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 0.
If you increase an ongoing timer of for example 13 minutes, it will increase it to 15. If the timer is set to 90, it will remove the time (hence the 0).

{% note %}
This button is disabled by default.
{% endnote %}

### Button `button.speaker_name_clear_sleep_timer`

Clear the sleep timer on a speaker, if one is set.

{% note %}
This button is disabled by default.
{% endnote %}

## Actions

The Bluesound integration makes some custom actions available in addition to the [standard media player actions](/integrations/media_player/#actions).

### Action: Join

The `bluesound.join` action allows you to group players together under a single master speaker. That will make a new group or join an existing group.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `master`               | no       | A single `entity_id` that will become/hold the master speaker.            |
| `entity_id`            | no       | String or list of a single `entity_id` that will group to master speaker. |

### Action: Unjoin

The `bluesound.unjoin` action allows you to remove one or more speakers from a group of speakers. If no `entity_id` is provided, all speakers are unjoined.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                      |
