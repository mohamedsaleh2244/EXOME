The **Template** {% term integration %} allows creating entities which derive their values from other data. This is done by specifying [templates](/docs/configuration/templating/) for properties of an entity, like the name or the state.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Alarm control panel](#alarm-control-panel)
- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Button](#button)
- [Cover](#cover)
- [Event](#event)
- [Fan](#fan)
- [Image](#image)
- [Light](#light)
- [Lock](#lock)
- [Number](#number)
- [Select](#select)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)
- [Update](#update)
- [Vacuum](#vacuum)
- [Weather](#weather)

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% important %}
To be able to add **{% my helpers title="Helpers" %}** via the user interface, you should have `default_config:` in your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}. It should already be there by default unless you removed it.
{% endimportant %}

{% note %}
Configuration using our user interface provides a more limited subset of options, making this integration more accessible while covering most use cases.

If you need more specific features for your use case, the manual [YAML-configuration section](#yaml-configuration) of this integration might provide them.
{% endnote %}

## YAML configuration

Entities are defined in your YAML configuration files under the `template:` key. You can define multiple configuration blocks as a list. Each block defines sensor/binary sensor/number/select entities and can contain optional update triggers.

### State-based template entities

Template entities will by default update as soon as any of the referenced data in the template updates.

For example, you can have a template that takes the averages of two sensors. Home Assistant will update your template sensor as soon as either source sensor updates.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Average temperature"
        unit_of_measurement: "°C"
        state: >
          {% set bedroom = states('sensor.bedroom_temperature') | float %}
          {% set kitchen = states('sensor.kitchen_temperature') | float %}

          {{ ((bedroom + kitchen) / 2) | round(1, default=0) }}
```

{% endraw %}

### Trigger-based template entities

If you want more control over when an entity updates, you can define triggers. Triggers follow the same format and work exactly the same as [triggers in automations][trigger-doc]. This feature is a great way to create entities based on webhook data ([example](#trigger-based-sensor-and-binary-sensor-storing-webhook-information)), or update entities based on a schedule.

Whenever a trigger fires, all related entities will re-render and it will have access to [the trigger data](/docs/automation/templating/) in the templates.

Trigger-based entities do not automatically update when states referenced in the templates change. This functionality can be added back by defining a [state trigger](/docs/automation/trigger/#state-trigger) for each entity that you want to trigger updates.

The state, including attributes, of trigger-based sensors and binary sensors is restored when Home Assistant is restarted. The state of other trigger-based template entities is not restored.

{% note %}
Buttons do not support using `trigger` or `action` options.
{% endnote %}

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
template:
  - triggers:
      - trigger: time_pattern
        # This will update every night
        hours: 0
        minutes: 0
    sensor:
      # Keep track how many days have past since a date
      - name: "Not smoking"
        state: '{{ ( ( as_timestamp(now()) - as_timestamp(strptime("06.07.2018", "%d.%m.%Y")) ) / 86400 ) | round(default=0) }}'
        unit_of_measurement: "Days"
```

{% endraw %}

### Configuration reference

{% configuration trigger-based %}
actions:
  description: Define actions to be executed when the trigger fires (for trigger-based entities only). Optional. Variables set by the action script are available when evaluating entity templates. This can be used to interact with anything using actions, in particular actions with [response data](/docs/scripts/perform-actions#use-templates-to-handle-response-data). [See action documentation](/docs/automation/action).
  required: false

{% endconfiguration %}

## Common Device Configuration Options

Each entity platform has its own set of configuration options, but there are some common options that can be used across all entity platforms.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      # Common configuration options
    - default_entity_id: binary_sensor.my_alert
      unique_id: my_unique_sensor_id
      variables:
        my_entity: sensor.watts
      availability: "{{ my_entity | has_value }}"
      icon: "{{ 'mdi:flash-alert' if states(my_entity) | float > 100 else 'mdi:flash' }}"
      name: "{{ states(my_entity) }} Alert"
      # Entity specific configuration options
      state: "{{ states(my_entity) | float > 100}}"
      device_class: problem
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration device %}
  availability:
    description: Defines a template to get the `available` state of the entity. If the template either fails to render or returns `True`, `"1"`, `"true"`, `"yes"`, `"on"`, `"enable"`, or a non-zero number, the entity will be `available`. If the template returns any other value, the entity will be `unavailable`. If not configured, the entity will always be `available`. Note that the string comparison is not case sensitive; `"TrUe"` and `"yEs"` are allowed.
    required: false
    type: template
    default: true
  default_entity_id:
    description: Use `default_entity_id` instead of name for automatic generation of the entity id. E.g. `sensor.my_awesome_sensor`. When used without a `unique_id`, the entity id will update during restart or reload if the entity id is available.  If the entity id already exists, the entity id will be created with a number at the end. When used with a `unique_id`, the `default_entity_id` is only used when the entity is added for the first time. When set, this overrides a user-customized Entity ID in case the entity was deleted and added again.
    required: false
    type: string

    description: Defines a template for the icon of the entity.
    required: false
    type: template

    required: false
    type: template
  unique_id:
    description: An ID that uniquely identifies this entity. Will be combined with the unique ID of the configuration block if available. This allows changing the `name`, `icon` and `entity_id` from the web interface.  Changing the `entity_id` from the web interface will overwrite the value in `default_entity_id`.
    required: false
    type: string
  variables:
    description: Key-value pairs of variable definitions which can be referenced and used in the templates below (for trigger-based entities only). Mostly used by blueprints. With State-based template entities, variables are only resolved when the configuration is loaded or reloaded. Trigger based template entities resolve variables between triggers and actions.

        description: The variable name and corresponding value.
        required: true
        type: string

{% endconfiguration %}

## Alarm Control Panel

The template alarm control panel platform allows you to create a alarm control panels with templates to define the state and scripts to define each actions.

Alarm control panel entities can be created from the frontend in the Helpers section or via YAML.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example state-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - alarm_control_panel:
      - name: "Alarm Control Panel 1"
        state: "{{ states('input_select.panel_1_state') }}"
        arm_away:
          action: script.arm_panel_away
        arm_home:
          action: script.arm_panel_home
        disarm:
          action: script.disarm_panel
```

```yaml
# Example trigger-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: input_select.panel_1_state
    alarm_control_panel:
      - name: "Alarm Control Panel 1"
        state: "{{ states('input_select.panel_1_state') }}"
        arm_away:
          action: script.arm_panel_away
        arm_home:
          action: script.arm_panel_home

    optimistic:
      description: Flag that defines if the alarm control panel works in optimistic mode. When enabled, the alarm control panel's state will update immediately when a new option is chosen through the UI or actions, without waiting for the template defined in `state` to update. When disabled (default), the alarm control panel will only update when the `state` template returns a new value.
      required: false
      type: boolean
      default: false
    state:
      description: "Defines a template to set the state of the alarm panel. Only the states `armed_away`, `armed_home`, `armed_night`, `armed_vacation`, `arming`, `disarmed`, `pending`, `triggered` and `unavailable` are used."
      required: false
      type: template
    trigger:
      description: Defines an action to run when the alarm is triggered.
      required: false
      type: action
{% endconfiguration %}

## Binary Sensor

The template binary sensor platform allows you to create binary sensors with templates to define the state and attributes.

Binary sensor entities can be created from the frontend in the Helpers section or via YAML.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example state-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: Sun Up
        state: >
          {{ is_state("sun.sun", "above_horizon") }}
```

```yaml
# Example trigger-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - triggers:
    - trigger: state
      entity_id: sun.sun
    binary_sensor:
      - name: Sun Up
        state: >
          {{ is_state("sun.sun", "above_horizon") }}
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration binary-sensor %}
binary_sensor:
  description: List of binary sensors
  required: true
  type: list
  keys:
    attributes:
      description: Defines templates for attributes of the entity.
      required: false
      type: map
      keys:
        "attribute: template":
          description: The attribute and corresponding template.
          required: true
          type: template
    auto_off:
      description: "**Requires a trigger.** After how much time the entity should turn off after it rendered 'on'."
      required: false
      type: time
    delay_off:
      description: The amount of time the template state must be ***not met*** before this sensor will switch to `off`. This can also be a template.
      required: false
      type: time
    delay_on:
      description: The amount of time (e.g. `0:00:05`) the template state must be ***met*** before this sensor will switch to `on`. This can also be a template.
      required: false
      type: time
    device_class:
      description: Sets the class of the device, changing the device state and icon that is displayed on the UI (see below). It does not set the `unit_of_measurement`.
      required: false
      type: device_class
      default: None
    state:
      description: The sensor is `on` if the template evaluates as `True`, `yes`, `on`, `enable` or a positive number. The sensor is `unknown` if the template evaluates as `None`. Any other value will render it as `off`. The actual appearance in the frontend (`Open`/`Closed`, `Detected`/`Clear` etc) depends on the sensor's device_class value
      required: true
      type: template

{% endconfiguration %}

### State based binary sensor - Washing Machine Running

This example creates a washing machine "load running" sensor by monitoring an
energy meter connected to the washer. During the washer's operation, the energy meter will fluctuate wildly, hitting zero frequently even before the load is finished. By utilizing `delay_off`, we can have this sensor only turn off if there has been no washer activity for 5 minutes.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
# Determine when the washing machine has a load running.
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "Washing Machine"
        delay_off:
          minutes: 5
        state: >
          {{ states('sensor.washing_machine_power')|float > 0 }}
```

{% endraw %}

### State based binary sensor - Is Anyone Home

This example is determining if anyone is home based on the combination of device tracking and motion sensors. It's extremely useful if you have kids/baby sitter/grand parents who might still be in your house that aren't represented by a trackable device in Home Assistant. This is providing a composite of Wi-Fi based device tracking and Z-Wave multisensor presence sensors.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: People home
        state: >
          {{ is_state('device_tracker.sean', 'home')
             or is_state('device_tracker.susan', 'home')
             or is_state('binary_sensor.office_124', 'on')
             or is_state('binary_sensor.hallway_134', 'on')
             or is_state('binary_sensor.living_room_139', 'on')
             or is_state('binary_sensor.porch_ms6_1_129', 'on')
             or is_state('binary_sensor.family_room_144', 'on') }}
```

{% endraw %}

### State based binary sensor - device tracker sensor with latitude and longitude attributes

This example shows how to combine a non-GPS (e.g., NMAP) and GPS device tracker while still including latitude and longitude attributes

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: My Device
        state: >
          {{ is_state('device_tracker.my_device_nmap', 'home') or is_state('device_tracker.my_device_gps', 'home') }}
        device_class: "presence"
        attributes:
          latitude: >
            {% if is_state('device_tracker.my_device_nmap', 'home') %}
              {{ state_attr('zone.home', 'latitude') }}
            {% else %}
              {{ state_attr('device_tracker.my_device_gps', 'latitude') }}
            {% endif %}
          longitude: >
            {% if is_state('device_tracker.my_device_nmap', 'home') %}
              {{ state_attr('zone.home', 'longitude') }}
            {% else %}
              {{ state_attr('device_tracker.my_device_gps', 'longitude') }}
            {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

### State based binary sensor - Change the icon when a state changes

This example demonstrates how to use template to change the icon as its state changes. This icon is referencing its own state.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: Sun Up
        state: >
          {{ is_state("sun.sun", "above_horizon") }}
        icon: >
          {% if is_state("binary_sensor.sun_up", "on") %}
            mdi:weather-sunset-up
          {% else %}
            mdi:weather-sunset-down
          {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

### Trigger based binary sensor - Change state and icon when a custom event is received

A more advanced use case could be to set the icon based on the sensor's own state like above, but when triggered by an event. This example demonstrates a binary sensor that turns on momentarily, such as when a doorbell button is pressed.

The binary sensor turns on and sets the matching icon when the appropriate event is received. After 5 seconds, the binary sensor turns off automatically. To ensure the icon gets updated, there must be a trigger for when the state changes to off.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - triggers:
      - trigger: event
        event_type: YOUR_EVENT
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.doorbell_rang
        to: "off"
    binary_sensor:
      name: doorbell_rang
      icon: "{{ (trigger.platform == 'event') | iif('mdi:bell-ring-outline', 'mdi:bell-outline') }}"
      state: "{{ trigger.platform == 'event' }}"
      auto_off:
        seconds: 5
```

{% endraw %}

## Button

The template button platform allows you to create button entities with scripts to define each action.

Button entities can be created from the frontend in the Helpers section or via YAML.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - button:
      - name: Fast Forward
        press:
          action: remote.send_command
          target:
            entity_id: remote.living_room
          data:
            command: fast_forward
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration button %}
button:
  description: List of buttons
  required: true
  type: map
  keys:
    press:
      description: Defines actions to run to press the button.
      required: true
      type: action
{% endconfiguration %}

## Cover

The template cover platform allows you to create covers with templates to define the state and scripts to define each action.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example state-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - cover:
      - name: Garage Door
        state: "{{ states('sensor.garage_door')|float > 0 }}"
        device_class: garage
        open_cover:
          action: script.open_garage_door
        close_cover:
          action: script.close_garage_door
        stop_cover:
          action: script.stop_garage_door
```

```yaml
# Example trigger-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: sensor.garage_door
    cover:
      - name: Garage Door
        state: "{{ trigger.to_state.state|float(0) > 0 }}"
        device_class: garage
        open_cover:
          action: script.open_garage_door
        close_cover:
          action: script.close_garage_door
        stop_cover:
          action: script.stop_garage_door
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration cover %}
cover:
  description: Characteristics of a cover
  type: map
  keys:
    close_cover:
      description: Defines an action to close the cover.
      required: inclusive

      required: false
      type: boolean
      default: false
    position:
      description: Defines a template to get the position of the cover. Legal values are numbers between `0` (closed) and `100` (open). If the template produces a `None` value the current position will be set to `unknown`.
      required: false

      type: action
    state:
      description: Defines a template to get the state of the cover. Valid output values from the template are `open`, `opening`, `closing` and `closed` which are directly mapped to the corresponding states. In addition, `true` is valid as a synonym to `open` and `false` as a synonym to `closed`. If [both a `state` and a `position` template](#combining-state-and-position-templates) are specified, only `opening` and `closing` are set from the `state` template. If the template produces a `None` value the state will be set to `unknown`.

      description: Force cover tilt position to use [optimistic mode](#cover-optimistic-mode).
      required: false
      type: boolean
      default: false

{% endconfiguration %}

### Cover Optimistic Mode

In optimistic mode, the cover position state is maintained internally. This mode is automatically enabled if neither `state` or `position` are specified. Note that this is unlikely to be very reliable without some feedback mechanism, since there is otherwise no way to know if the cover is moving properly. The cover can be forced into optimistic mode by using the `optimistic` attribute. There is an equivalent mode for `tilt_position` that is enabled when `tilt` is not specified or when the `tilt_optimistic` attribute is used.

### Combining `state` and `position` templates

If both a `state` and a `position` are specified only `opening` and `closing` states are set directly from the `state`, the `open` and `closed` states will instead be derived from the cover position.

| value_template output | result                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| open                  | state defined by `position_template` |
| closed                | state defined by `position_template` |
| true                  | state defined by `position_template` |
| false                 | state defined by `position_template` |
| opening               | state set to `opening`               |
| closing               | state set to `closing`               |
| <any other output>    | No change of state or position       |

### State based cover - Garage Door

This example converts a garage door with a controllable switch and position sensor into a cover. The condition check is optional, but suggested if you use the same switch to open and close the garage.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - cover:
      - name: Garage Door
        device_class: garage
        position: "{{ states('sensor.garage_door') }}"
        open_cover:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: sensor.garage_door
            state: "off"
          - action: switch.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: switch.garage_door
        close_cover:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: sensor.garage_door
            state: "on"
          - action: switch.turn_off
            target:
              entity_id: switch.garage_door
        stop_cover:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.garage_door
        icon: >-
          {% if states('sensor.garage_door')|float > 0 %}
            mdi:garage-open
          {% else %}
            mdi:garage
          {% endif %}
```

        device_class: garage
        open_cover:
          - action: switch.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: switch.garage_door
        close_cover:
          - action: switch.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: switch.garage_door
        stop_cover:

### Converting from speeds to percentage

When converting a fan with 3 speeds from the old fan entity model, the following percentages can be used:

0 - `off`
33 - `low`
66 - `medium`
100 - `high`

### State based fan - Helper fan

This example uses an input_boolean and an input_number to mimic a fan, and the example shows multiple actions for `set_percentage`.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - fan:
      - name: "Helper Fan"
        state: "{{ states('input_boolean.state') }}"
        turn_on:
          - action: input_boolean.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: input_boolean.state
        turn_off:
          - action: input_boolean.turn_off
            target:
              entity_id: input_boolean.state
        speed_count: 6
        percentage: >
          {{ states('input_number.percentage') if is_state('input_boolean.state', 'on') else 0 }}
        set_percentage:
          - action: input_boolean.turn_{{ 'on' if percentage > 0 else 'off' }}
            target:
              entity_id: input_boolean.state
          - action: input_number.set_value
            target:
              entity_id: input_number.percentage
            data:
              value: "{{ percentage }}"
```

{% endraw %}

### State based fan - Fan with preset modes

This example uses an existing fan with only a percentage. It extends the percentage value into useable preset modes without a helper entity.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - fan:
      - name: "Preset Mode Fan Example"
        state: "{{ states('fan.percentage_fan') }}"

              percentage: >-
                {% if preset_mode == 'high' %}
                  100
                {% elif preset_mode == 'medium' %}
                  66
                {% elif preset_mode == 'low' %}
                  33
                {% else %}
                  0
                {% endif %}

### Light Considerations

Transition doesn't have its own script, it will instead be passed as a named parameter `transition` to the `turn_on`, `turn_off`, `brightness`, `color_temp`, `effect`, `hs_color`, `rgb_color`, `rgbw_color` or `rgbww_color` scripts. Brightness will be passed as a named parameter `brightness` to either of `turn_on`, `color_temp`, `effect`, `hs_color`, `rgb_color`, `rgbw_color` or `rgbww_color` scripts if the corresponding parameter is also in the call. In this case, the brightness script (`set_level`) will not be called. If only brightness is passed to `light.turn_on` action, then `set_level` script is called.

### State based light - Theater Volume Control

This example shows a light that is actually a home theater's volume. This
integration gives you the flexibility to provide whatever you'd like to send as
the payload to the consumer including any scale conversions you may need to
make; the [media player integration](/integrations/media_player/) needs a floating
point percentage value from `0.0` to `1.0`.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - light:
      - name: Receiver Volume
        state: >-
          {% if is_state('media_player.receiver', 'on') %}

### State based light - Make a global light entity for a multi-segment WLED light

This example shows how to group together 2 RGBW segments from the same WLED controller into a single usable light.

{% raw %}

```yaml

            effect: "{{ effect }}"
```

{% endraw %}

## Lock

The template lock platform allows you to create locks with templates to define the state and scripts to define each action.

Lock entities can only be created from YAML.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example state-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - lock:
      - name: Garage door
        state: "{{ is_state('sensor.door', 'on') }}"
        lock:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.door
        unlock:
          action: switch.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: switch.door
```

```yaml
# Example trigger-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: sensor.door
    lock:
      - name: Garage door
        state: "{{ trigger.to_state.state == 'on' }}"
        lock:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.door
        unlock:
          action: switch.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: switch.door
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration lock %}
lock:
  description: List of locks
  required: true
  type: map
  keys:
    code_format:
      description: Defines a template to get the `code_format` attribute of the entity. This template must evaluate to a valid [Python regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax) or `None`. If it evaluates to a not-`None` value, you are prompted to enter a code when interacting with the lock. The code will be matched against the regular expression, and the lock/unlock actions will be executed only if they match. The actual _validity_ of the entered code must be verified within these actions. If there's a syntax error in the template, the entity will be unavailable. If the template fails to render for other reasons or if the regular expression is invalid, no code will be accepted, and the lock/unlock actions will never be invoked.
      required: false
      type: template
      default: None
    lock:
      description: Defines an action to run when the lock is locked.
      required: true

      description: Defines an action to run when the lock is opened.
      required: false
      type: action
    optimistic:
      description: Flag that defines if the lock works in optimistic mode. When enabled, the lock's state will update immediately when a new option is chosen through the UI or actions, without waiting for the template defined in `state` to update. When disabled (default), the lock will only update when the `state` template returns a new value.
      required: false
      type: boolean
      default: false
    state:
      description: Defines a template to set the state of the lock. Valid output values from the template are `locked`, `unlocked`, `open`, `locking`, `unlocking`, `opening`, and `jammed`, which are directly mapped to the corresponding states. In addition, `true` and `on` are valid as synonyms to `locked` while `false` and `off` are valid as synonyms to `unlocked`.
      required: false
      default: optimistic
      type: template
    unlock:
      description: Defines an action to run when the lock is unlocked.
      required: true

{% endconfiguration %}

### State based lock - Lock from a switch

This example shows a lock that copies data from a switch.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - lock:
      - name: Garage Door
        state: "{{ is_state('switch.source', 'on') }}"
        lock:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.source
        unlock:
          action: switch.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: switch.source
```

{% endraw %}

### State based lock - Optimistic mode

This example shows a lock in optimistic mode. This lock will immediately change state after command and will not wait for state update from the sensor.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - lock:
      - name: Garage Door
        state: "{{ is_state('sensor.skylight.state', 'on') }}"
        optimistic: true
        lock:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.source
        unlock:
          action: switch.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: switch.source
```

{% endraw %}

### State based lock - Sensor and Two Switches

This example shows a lock that takes its state from a sensor, and uses two momentary switches to control a device.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - lock:
      - name: Garage Door
        state: "{{ is_state('sensor.skylight.state', 'on') }}"
        lock:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.skylight_open
        unlock:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.skylight_close
```

{% endraw %}

### State based lock - Secret code

This example shows a lock that copies data from a switch. It needs a PIN code defined as a [secret](/docs/configuration/secrets) to unlock and no code to lock. Note that the actual validity check of the code is part of the `unlock` action and should always happen there or in scripts called from these actions. In this way, you can not only perform code checks against static values, but also dynamic ones (for instance, TOTPs).

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - lock:
      - name: Garage Door
        state: "{{ is_state('switch.source', 'on') }}"
        code_format: "{{ '\\d{4}' if is_state('switch.source', 'on') else None }}"
        lock:
          - action: switch.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: switch.source
        unlock:
          - variables:
              pin: !secret garage_door_pin
          - condition: "{{ code|int == pin|int }}"
          - action: switch.turn_off
            target:
              entity_id: switch.source
```

{% endraw %}

In `secrets.yaml`:

{% raw %}

```yaml
garage_door_pin: "1234"
```

{% endraw %}

## Number

The template number platform allows you to create number entities with templates to define the state and scripts to define each action.

Number entities can be created from the frontend in the Helpers section or via YAML.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example state-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - number:
      - name: Desk Height
        unit_of_measurement: "in"
        state: "{{ states('sensor.desk_height') }}"
        set_value:
          - action: script.set_desk_height
            data:
              value: "{{ value }}"
        step: 0.5
        min: 1
        max: 24
        icon: mdi:ruler
```

```yaml
# Example trigger-based configuration.yaml entry

        state: "{{ states('sensor.desk_height') }}"
        set_value:
          - action: script.set_desk_height
            data:
              value: "{{ value }}"
        step: 0.5

      description: Template for the number's increment/decrement step.
      required: false
      type: template
      default: 1.0

{% endconfiguration %}

### State based number - Changing the unit of measurement of another number

This example demonstrates the usage of a template number with a unit of measurement set to change a unit-less value of another number entity.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - number:
      - name: "Cutting Height"
        unit_of_measurement: "cm"
        unique_id: automower_cutting_height
        state: "{{ states('number.automower_cutting_height_raw')|int(0) * 0.5 + 1.5 }}"
        set_value:
          - action: number.set_value
            target:
              entity_id: number.automower_cutting_height_raw
            data:
              value: "{{ (value - 1.5) * 2 }}"
        step: 0.5
        min: 2
        max: 6
        icon: mdi:ruler
```

{% endraw %}

## Select

The template select platform allows you to create select entities with templates to define the state and scripts to define each action.

Select entities can be created from the frontend in the Helpers section or via YAML.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example state-based configuration.yaml entry

### State based select - Control Day/Night mode of a camera

This show how a state based template select can be used to perform an action.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  select:

## Sensor

The template sensor platform allows you to create sensors with templates to define the state and attributes.

Sensor entities can be created from the frontend in the Helpers section or via YAML.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example state-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Kettle"
        state: >
          {% if is_state('switch.kettle', 'off') %}
            off
          {% elif state_attr('switch.kettle', 'W')|float < 1000 %}
            standby
          {% elif is_state('switch.kettle', 'on') %}
            on
          {% else %}
            failed
          {% endif %}
```

```yaml
# Example trigger-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: sensor.outside_temperature
        not_to:
        - unknown
        - unavailable
    sensor:
      - name: Outside Temperature
        device_class: temperature
        unit_of_measurement: °C
        state: "{{ (states('sensor.outside_temperature') | float - 32) * 5/9 }}"
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration sensor %}
sensor:
  description: List of sensors
  required: true
  type: list
  keys:
    attributes:
      description: Defines templates for attributes of the entity.
      required: false
      type: map
      keys:
        "attribute: template":

      required: false
      type: template
      default: None
    state:
      description: "Defines a template to get the state of the sensor. If the sensor is numeric, i.e. it has a `state_class` or a `unit_of_measurement`, the state template must render to a number or to `none`. The state template must not render to a string, including `unknown` or `unavailable`. An `availability` template may be defined to suppress rendering of the state template."
      required: true
      type: template
    state_class:
      description: "The [state_class](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor#available-state-classes) of the sensor. This will also display the value based on the user profile Number Format setting and influence the graphical presentation in the history visualization as a continuous value. If you desire to include the sensor in {% term "Long-term statistics" %}, include this key and assign it the appropriate value"
      required: false
      type: string
      default: None
    unit_of_measurement:

{% endconfiguration %}

### State based sensor - Exposing sun angle

This example shows the sun angle in the frontend.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: Sun Angle
        unit_of_measurement: "°"
        state: "{{ '%+.1f'|format(state_attr('sun.sun', 'elevation')) }}"
```

{% endraw %}

### State based sensor - Modifying another sensor's output

If you don't like the wording of a sensor output, then the Template Sensor can help too. Let's rename the output of the [Sun integration](/integrations/sun/) as a simple example:

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Sun State"
        state: >
          {% if is_state('sun.sun', 'above_horizon') %}
            up
          {% else %}
            down
          {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

### State based sensor - Changing the unit of measurement of another sensor

With a Template Sensor, it's easy to convert given values into others if the unit of measurement doesn't fit your needs.
Because the sensors do math on the source sensor's state and need to render to a numeric value, an availability template is used
to suppress rendering of the state template if the source sensor does not have a valid numeric state.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Transmission Down Speed"
        unit_of_measurement: "kB/s"
        state: "{{ states('sensor.transmission_down_speed')|float * 1024 }}"
        availability: "{{ is_number(states('sensor.transmission_down_speed')) }}"

      - name: "Transmission Up Speed"
        unit_of_measurement: "kB/s"
        state: "{{ states('sensor.transmission_up_speed')|float * 1024 }}"
        availability: "{{ is_number(states('sensor.transmission_up_speed')) }}"
```

{% endraw %}

### Trigger based sensor - Using conditions to control updates

This example shows how to store the last valid value of a temperature sensor. It will update as long as the source sensor has a valid (numeric) state. Otherwise, the template sensor's state will remain unchanged.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - triggers:
      trigger: state
      entity_id: sensor.outside_temperature
    conditions:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ is_number(states('sensor.outside_temperature')) }}"
    sensor:
      - name: Outside Temperature last known value
        state: "{{ states('sensor.outside_temperature') }}"
```

{% endraw %}

## Switch

The template switch platform allows you to create switches with templates to define the state and scripts to define each action.

Switch entities can be created from the frontend in the Helpers section or via YAML.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example state-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - switch:
      - name: Skylight
        state: "{{ is_state('binary_sensor.skylight', 'on') }}"
        turn_on:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.skylight_open
        turn_off:
          action: switch.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: switch.skylight_close
```

```yaml
# Example trigger-based configuration.yaml entry
template:
  - triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.skylight
    switch:
      - name: Skylight
        state: "{{ is_state('binary_sensor.skylight', 'on') }}"
        turn_on:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.skylight_open
        turn_off:
          action: switch.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: switch.skylight_close
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration switch %}
switch:
  description: List of switches
  required: true
  type: map
  keys:
    optimistic:
      description: Flag that defines if the switch works in optimistic mode. When enabled, the switch's state will update immediately when a new option is chosen through the UI or actions, without waiting for the template defined in `state` to update. When disabled (default), the switch will only update when the `state` template returns a new value.
      required: false
      type: boolean
      default: false
    state:
      description: Defines a template to set the state of the switch. If not defined, the switch will optimistically assume all commands are successful.
      required: false
      type: template
      default: optimistic
    turn_off:
      description: Defines an action or list of actions to run when the switch is turned off.
      required: true
      type: action
    turn_on:
      description: Defines an action or list of actions to run when the switch is turned on.
      required: true
      type: action

{% endconfiguration %}

### State based switch - Invert a Switch

This example shows a switch that is the inverse of another switch.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - switch:
      - state: "{{ not is_state('switch.target', 'on') }}"
        availability: "{{ has_value('switch.target') }}"
        turn_on:
          action: switch.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: switch.target
        turn_off:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.target
```

{% endraw %}

### State based switch - Toggle Switch

This example shows a switch that takes its state from a sensor and toggles a switch.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - switch:
      - name: "Blind"
        state: "{{ is_state_attr('switch.blind_toggle', 'sensor_state', 'on') }}"
        turn_on:
          action: switch.toggle
          target:
            entity_id: switch.blind_toggle
        turn_off:
          action: switch.toggle
          target:
            entity_id: switch.blind_toggle
```

{% endraw %}

### State based switch - Sensor and Two Switches

This example shows a switch that takes its state from a sensor, and uses two
momentary switches to control a device.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - switch:
      - name: "Skylight"
        value_template: "{{ is_state('sensor.skylight', 'on') }}"
        turn_on:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.skylight_open
        turn_off:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.skylight_close
```

{% endraw %}

### State based switch - Optimistic Switch

This example switch with an assumed state based on the actions performed. This switch will immediately change state after a `turn_on`/`turn_off` command.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - switch:
      - name: "Blind"
        turn_on:
          action: switch.toggle
          target:
            entity_id: switch.blind_toggle
        turn_off:
          action: switch.toggle
          target:
            entity_id: switch.blind_toggle
```

{% endraw %}

## Update

### Weather Forecast data

The weather forecast options should return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains [forecast information](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weather/#action-weatherget_forecasts) for the current timeframe. The data is slightly different for each forecast type: `hourly`, `daily`, and `twice_daily`.

#### Hourly Weather Forecast

The `hourly` forecast should contain 24 dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a specific hour within the next 24 hour period. The `hourly` data should start at the current hour and end 24 hours from that point. The `datetime` in each dictionary should represent the start of the hour in your local timezone.

#### Daily Weather Forecast

The `daily` forecast should contain dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a specific day within any desired timeframe. The `daily` data should start at midnight tonight and end on the last day of your desired timeframe, incrementing 1 day at a time. The `datetime` in each dictionary should represent midnight for each night in your local timezone.

#### Twice Daily Weather Forecast

The `twice_daily` forecast should contain dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a specific 12 hour period within any desired timeframe. The `twice_daily` should start at the closest 12 hour period and end on the last 12 hour period of your desired timeframe.  The `datetime` in each dictionary should represent midnight or noon for each day in your local timezone.  Keep in mind, `is_daytime` is mandatory in every dictionary output to `twice_daily` forecasts.

### Trigger based weather - Weather Forecast from response data

This example demonstrates how to use an `action` to call a [action with response data](/docs/scripts/perform-actions/#use-templates-to-handle-response-data)
and use the response in a template.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - triggers:
      - trigger: time_pattern
        hours: /1
    actions:
      - action: weather.get_forecasts
        data:
          type: hourly
        target:
          entity_id: weather.home
        response_variable: hourly
    sensor:
      - name: Weather Forecast Hourly
        unique_id: weather_forecast_hourly
        state: "{{ now().isoformat() }}"
        attributes:
          forecast: "{{ hourly['weather.home'].forecast }}"
```

{% endraw %}

#### Video tutorial

This video tutorial explains how to set up a trigger based template that makes use of an action to retrieve the weather forecast (precipitation).

## Combining multiple template entities

The template integration allows defining multiple sections.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry with two sections
template:
  # Define state-based template entities
  - sensor:
      ...
  - binary_sensor:
      ...

  # Define trigger-based template entities
  - triggers:
      ...
    sensor:
      ...
    binary_sensor:
      ...
```

[trigger-doc]: /docs/automation/trigger

### Trigger based sensor and binary sensor storing webhook information

Template entities can be triggered using any automation trigger, including webhook triggers. Use a trigger-based template entity to store this information in template entities.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - triggers:
      - trigger: webhook
        webhook_id: my-super-secret-webhook-id
    sensor:
      - name: "Webhook Temperature"
        state: "{{ trigger.json.temperature }}"
        unit_of_measurement: °C

      - name: "Webhook Humidity"
        state: "{{ trigger.json.humidity }}"
        unit_of_measurement: %

    binary_sensor:
      - name: "Motion"
        state: "{{ trigger.json.motion }}"
        device_class: motion
```

{% endraw %}

You can test this trigger entity with the following CURL command:

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"temperature": 5, "humidity": 34, "motion": true}' \
  http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/webhook/my-super-secret-webhook-id
```

## Template and action variables

State-based and trigger-based template entities have the special template variable `this` available in their templates and actions. The `this` variable is the current [state object](/docs/configuration/state_object) of the entity and aids [self-referencing](#self-referencing) of an entity's state and attributes in templates and actions. Trigger-based entities also provide [the trigger data](/docs/automation/templating/).

{% note %}
Self-referencing using `this` provides the state and attributes for the entity before rendering the templates to calculate a new state. In other words, it contains the previous state.
{% endnote %}

### Self referencing

This example demonstrates how the `this` variable can be used in templates for self-referencing.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: test
        state: "{{ this.attributes.test | default('Value when missing') }}"
        # not: "{{ state_attr('sensor.test', 'test') }}"
        attributes:
          test: "{{ now() }}"
```

{% endraw %}

## Optimistic mode

For template entities that support interactivity (like `number` and `select`), you can enable optimistic mode by setting the `optimistic` parameter to `true`. This affects how the entity's state updates when you interact with it:

- **With optimistic mode disabled (default)**: When you interact with the entity (for example, selecting a new option in a dropdown or setting a new number value), the entity's state in Home Assistant will only update after the underlying template defined in the `state` parameter returns the new value.

- **With optimistic mode enabled**: When you interact with the entity, the entity's state in Home Assistant immediately updates to reflect your change, without waiting for the `state` template to update. This provides a more responsive UI experience but may not reflect the actual state if the underlying action fails or takes time to complete.

Optimistic mode is particularly useful when:

- The underlying system doesn't provide immediate feedback
- You want a more responsive UI experience
- You're confident the action will succeed

When optimistic mode is disabled (default), you get more accuracy but potentially a less responsive UI, as the entity only updates after confirmation from the underlying system.

## Rate limiting updates

When there are entities present in the template and no triggers are defined, the template will be re-rendered when one of the entities changes states. To avoid this taking up too many resources in Home Assistant, rate limiting will be automatically applied if too many states are observed.

{% tip %}
<a href='#trigger-based-template-sensors'>Define a trigger</a> to avoid a rate limit and get more control over entity updates.
{% endtip %}

When `states` is used in a template by itself to iterate all states on the system, the template is re-rendered each
time any state changed event happens if any part of the state is accessed. When merely counting states, the template
is only re-rendered when a state is added or removed from the system. On busy systems with many entities or hundreds of
thousands state changed events per day, templates may re-render more than desirable.

In the below example, re-renders are limited to once per minute because we iterate over all available entities:

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "Has Unavailable States"
        state: "{{ states | selectattr('state', 'in', ['unavailable', 'unknown', 'none']) | list | count }}"
```

{% endraw %}

In the below example, re-renders are limited to once per second because we iterate over all entities in a single domain (sensor):

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "Has Unavailable States"
        state: "{{ states.sensor | selectattr('state', 'in', ['unavailable', 'unknown', 'none']) | list | count }}"
```

{% endraw %}

If the template accesses every state on the system, a rate limit of one update per minute is applied. If the template accesses all states under a specific domain, a rate limit of one update per second is applied. If the template only accesses specific states, receives update events for specifically referenced entities, or the `homeassistant.update_entity` action is used, no rate limit is applied.

## Considerations

### Startup

If you are using the state of a platform that might not be available during startup, the Template Sensor may get an `unknown` state. To avoid this, use the `states()` function in your template. For example, you should replace {% raw %}`{{ states.sensor.moon.state }}`{% endraw %} with this equivalent that returns the state and never results in `unknown`: {% raw %}`{{ states('sensor.moon') }}` {% endraw %}.

The same would apply to the `is_state()` function. You should replace {% raw %}`{{ states.switch.source.state == 'on' }}`{% endraw %} with this equivalent that returns `true`/`false` and never gives an `unknown` result:

{% raw %}

```yaml
{{ is_state('switch.source', 'on') }}
```

{% endraw %}

## Using blueprints

If you're just starting out and are not really familiar with templates, we recommend that you start with {% term blueprint %} template entities. These are template entities which are ready-made by the community and that you only need to configure.

Each blueprint contains the "recipe" for creating a single template entity, but you can create multiple template entities based on the same blueprint.

To create your first template entity based on a blueprint, open up your `configuration.yaml` file and add:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml template entity based on a blueprint located in config/blueprints/homeassistant/inverted_binary_sensor.yaml
template:
  - use_blueprint:
      path: homeassistant/inverted_binary_sensor.yaml # relative to config/blueprints/template/
      input:
        reference_entity: binary_sensor.foo
    name: Inverted foo
    unique_id: inverted_foo
```

If you look at the blueprint definition, you will notice it has one input defined (`reference_entity`), which expects a `binary_sensor` entity ID. When you create a template entity based on that blueprint, you will have to tell it which of your `binary_sensor` entities it should use to fill that spot.

### Importing blueprints

Home Assistant can import blueprints from the Home Assistant forums, GitHub, and GitHub gists.

1. To import a blueprint, first [find a blueprint you want to import][blueprint-forums].
   - If you just want to practice importing, you can use this URL:

      ```text
      https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/template/blueprints/inverted_binary_sensor.yaml
      ```

2. Download the file and place it under `config/blueprints/template/<source or author>/<blueprint name>.yaml`
3. Use a config similar to the one above to create a new template entity based on the blueprint you just imported.
4. Make sure to fill in all required inputs.

The blueprint can now be used for creating template entities.

## Event `event_template_reloaded`

Event `event_template_reloaded` is fired when Template entities have been reloaded and entities thus might have changed.

This event has no additional data.

## Legacy template deprecation migration guide

Legacy template entities are deprecated and will be removed in Home Assistant 2026.6.0. The deprecated template entities will produce a repair that guides you through the migration.

### Migrating a legacy sensor into a new template section

This example covers how to migrate a legacy template sensor into modern syntax.

Take the example `configuration.yaml` file

{% raw %}
```yaml
# configuration.yaml
sensor:
# SNMP Configuration
- platform: snmp
  host: 192.168.1.32
  baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1

# Legacy template configuration
- platform: template
  sensors:
    my_light_count:
      friendly_name: Total lights on
      unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
      value_template: "{{ states.light | selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on') | list | count }}"
```

{% endraw %}
To get started with the migration:

1. Remove the `sensor` template definition from the `configuration.yaml` `sensor:` section.

    Delete the following YAML from `configuration.yaml` file.

{% raw %}
    ```yaml
    # Legacy template configuration
    - platform: template
      sensors:
        my_light_count:
          friendly_name: Total lights on
          unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
          value_template: "{{ states.light | selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on') | list | count }}"
      ```
{% endraw %}

      Make sure to keep all the other platforms in the sensor section. Your `configuration.yaml` file would look like this after the change:

    ```yaml
    # configuration.yaml
    sensor:
    # SNMP Configuration
    - platform: snmp
      host: 192.168.1.32
      baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1
    ```

1. Add the modern syntax provided by the repair.

    The repair would provide the following YAML.
  
  {% raw %}
    ```yaml
    template:
    - sensor:
      - default_entity_id: sensor.my_light_count
        name: Total lights on
        unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
        state: '{{ states.light | selectattr(''state'', ''eq'', ''on'') | list | count }}'
    ```
   {% endraw %}
  
    This YAML should be added to the `template:` section inside `configuration.yaml`.

{% raw %}
    ```yaml
    # configuration.yaml
    sensor:
      # SNMP Configuration
    - platform: snmp
      host: 192.168.1.32
      baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1

    # Copied example
    template:
    - sensor:
      - default_entity_id: sensor.my_light_count
        name: Total lights on
        unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
        state: '{{ states.light | selectattr(''state'', ''eq'', ''on'') | list | count }}'
    ```
    {% endraw %}

    If you are migrating multiple template entities, ensure there is only 1 `template:` section.  Do not keep duplicate `template:` sections.

{% raw %}
    ```yaml
    # configuration.yaml
    sensor:
      # SNMP Configuration
    - platform: snmp
      host: 192.168.1.32
      baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1

    template:
    
    # Migrated sensor
    - sensor:
      - default_entity_id: sensor.my_light_count
        name: Total lights on
        unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
        state: '{{ states.light | selectattr(''state'', ''eq'', ''on'') | list | count }}'

    # Migrated cover
    - cover:
      - default_entity_id: cover.garage
        name: Garage Cover
        state: '{{ is_state(''binary_sensor.relay'', ''on'') }}'
  
    # Migrated light
    - light:
      - default_entity_id: light.skylight
        name: Skylight
        state: '{{ is_state(''binary_sensor.crank'', ''on'') }}'
    ```
{% endraw %}

1. Restart Home Assistant by going to **Settings** three dotted menu and selecting **Restart Home Assistant**.  Or reload template entities by going to **Developer tools** **YAML** tab and selecting the **Template entities** reload button.

### Migrating a legacy sensor into an existing template section

This example covers how to migrate a legacy template sensor into modern syntax.

Take the example `configuration.yaml` file

{% raw %}
```yaml
# configuration.yaml
sensor:
# SNMP Configuration
- platform: snmp
  host: 192.168.1.32
  baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1

# Legacy template configuration
- platform: template
  sensors:
    my_light_count:
      friendly_name: Total lights on
      unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
      value_template: "{{ states.light | selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on') | list | count }}"

template:
# Existing modern template
- binary_sensor:
  - name: Bright Outside
    state: "{{ states('sensor.lux_value') | float(0) > 10 }}"
```
{% endraw %}

To get started with the migration:

1. Remove the `sensor` template definition from the `configuration.yaml` `sensor:` section.

    Delete the following YAML from `configuration.yaml` file.

{% raw %}
    ```yaml
    # Legacy template configuration
    - platform: template
      sensors:
        my_light_count:
          friendly_name: Total lights on
          unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
          value_template: "{{ states.light | selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on') | list | count }}"
      ```
{% endraw %}

      Make sure to keep all the other platforms in the sensor section. Your `configuration.yaml` file would look like this after the change:

{% raw %}
    ```yaml
    # configuration.yaml
    sensor:
    # SNMP Configuration
    - platform: snmp
      host: 192.168.1.32
      baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1

    template:
    # Existing modern template
    - binary_sensor:
      - name: Bright Outside
        state: "{{ states('sensor.lux_value') | float(0) > 10 }}"
    ```
{% endraw %}

1. Add the modern syntax provided by the repair.

    The repair would provide the following YAML.
  
  {% raw %}
    ```yaml
    template:
    - sensor:
      - default_entity_id: sensor.my_light_count
        name: Total lights on
        unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
        state: '{{ states.light | selectattr(''state'', ''eq'', ''on'') | list | count }}'
    ```
{% endraw %}
  
    This YAML should be added to the `template:` section inside `configuration.yaml`.

{% raw %}
    ```yaml
    # configuration.yaml
    sensor:
      # SNMP Configuration
    - platform: snmp
      host: 192.168.1.32
      baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1

    template:
    # Existing modern template
    - binary_sensor:
      - name: Bright Outside
        state: "{{ states('sensor.lux_value') | float(0) > 10 }}"
    
    # Copied example
    - sensor:
      - default_entity_id: sensor.my_light_count
        name: Total lights on
        unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
        state: '{{ states.light | selectattr(''state'', ''eq'', ''on'') | list | count }}'
    ```
{% endraw %}

    In this example, `configuration.yaml` already had a `template:` section.  When copying the YAML, make sure to avoid adding double `template:` sections.

1. Restart Home Assistant by going to **Settings** three dotted menu and selecting **Restart Home Assistant**.  Or reload template entities by going to **Developer tools** **YAML** tab and selecting the **Template entities** reload button.

### Migrating a sensor from an included file to an included file

This example covers how to migrate a legacy template sensor into modern syntax when the sensor exists in an included `sensors.yaml` file.

Take the example configuration. It's a configuration that is split between 3 files, `configuration.yaml`, `sensors.yaml`, and `templates.yaml`.

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
sensor: !include sensors.yaml
template: !include templates.yaml
```

{% raw %}
```yaml
# sensors.yaml

# SNMP Configuration
- platform: snmp
  host: 192.168.1.32
  baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1

# Legacy template configuration
- platform: template
  sensors:
    my_light_count:
      friendly_name: Total lights on
      unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
      value_template: "{{ states.light | selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on') | list | count }}"
```

{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
```yaml
# templates.yaml

# Existing modern template
- binary_sensor:
  - name: Bright Outside
    state: "{{ states('sensor.lux_value') | float(0) > 10 }}"
```
{% endraw %}

To get started with the migration:

1. Remove the `sensor` template definition from the `sensors.yaml` section.

    Delete the following YAML from `sensors.yaml` file.

{% raw %}
    ```yaml
    # Legacy template configuration
    - platform: template
      sensors:
        my_light_count:
          friendly_name: Total lights on
          unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
          value_template: "{{ states.light | selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on') | list | count }}"
      ```

{% endraw %}
      Make sure to keep all the other platforms in the sensor file. Your `sensors.yaml` file would look like this after the change:


    ```yaml
    # sensors.yaml
  
    # SNMP Configuration
    - platform: snmp
      host: 192.168.1.32
      baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1
    ```

2. Add the modern syntax provided by the repair.

    The repair would provide the following YAML.
  
  {% raw %}
    ```yaml
    template:
    - sensor:
      - default_entity_id: sensor.my_light_count
        name: Total lights on
        unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
        state: '{{ states.light | selectattr(''state'', ''eq'', ''on'') | list | count }}'
    ```
  
  {% endraw %}
    This YAML should be added to the `templates.yaml` file.

{% raw %}
    ```yaml
    # templates.yaml

    # Existing modern template
    - binary_sensor:
      - name: Bright Outside
        state: "{{ states('sensor.lux_value') | float(0) > 10 }}"
    
    # Copied example
    - sensor:
      - default_entity_id: sensor.my_light_count
        name: Total lights on
        unique_id: sa892hfa9sdf8
        state: '{{ states.light | selectattr(''state'', ''eq'', ''on'') | list | count }}'
    ```

{% endraw %}

    In this example, `configuration.yaml` already has a `template: !include templates.yaml`.  When copying the yaml, make sure to avoid adding the `template:` section inside `templates.yaml`.

1. Restart Home Assistant by going to **Settings** three dotted menu and selecting **Restart Home Assistant**.  Or reload template entities by going to **Developer tools** **YAML** tab and selecting the **Template entities** reload button.
