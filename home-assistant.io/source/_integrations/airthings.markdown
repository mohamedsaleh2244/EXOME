Integrates Airthings sensors into Home Assistant.

[Airthings](https://www.airthings.com/) provide different sensors for measuring the air quality. The focus specially on Radon sensors.

While this integration works without an Airthings SmartLink hub, using one will provide live updates to your sensor data. Without a hub, you'll need to rely on the Airthings mobile app to sync data over Bluetooth and upload it to the cloud.

Requires Airthings hardware and a valid Airthings Dashboard login.

## Prerequisites

Airthings API setup (needed to acquire the required ID and Secret for the Home Assistant Airthings Integration).

1. Login [here](https://dashboard.airthings.com/integrations/api-integration) to find your credentials.
2. Select [Integrations](https://dashboard.airthings.com/integrations/api-integration) from the left side-bar.
3. Click on "Request API Client" in order to set up an API connection.
4. Name your API connection (e.g., "Home Assistant"). Note: The name field has a character limit and longer names will be truncated.
5. Give the connection an accurate description.
6. Select a Resource Scope.
7. Select an access Type, i.e., Confidential.
8. Select a flow type.
9. Set enable to "on".
10. Save the settings.

Upon saving the settings, you will be presented with a generated id and secret.

The Airthings integration can now be activated using the generated id and secret that you have just created.

## Troubleshooting


### The radon sensor does not show up
 
Initially, the radon sensor may not be published by the Airthings API (at device startup, the value is considered "unknown"), and so you may have to wait for the radon sensor to appear for a new device.
