The [SMLIGHT](https://smlight.tech) SLZB-06x Ethernet Zigbee coordinators provide a reliable and convenient way to integrate Zigbee devices into your smart home setup. By placing the Zigbee gateway closer to your devices, you can improve connectivity and reduce interference, avoiding the limitations of gateways hidden in cupboards or distant locations.

The **SMLIGHT SLZB** {% term integration %} allows you to monitor and manage your SLZB devices directly from Home Assistant. This integration provides direct access to many features available in the SLZB device's web UI, such as managing firmware updates, monitoring device health through diagnostic sensors, and controlling settings like LED modes or restarting the device. These features can also be incorporated into your automations for central control.

## Prerequisites

You need a supported SLZB-06 adapter.

 This integration has been tested with the following devices:

- [SLZB-06](https://smlight.tech/product/slzb-06)
- [SLZB-06M](https://smlight.tech/product/slzb-06m)
- [SLZB-06Mg24](https://smlight.tech/product/slzb-06mg24)
- [SLZB-06p7](https://smlight.tech/product/slzb-06p7)
- [SLZB-06p10](https://smlight.tech/product/slzb-06p10/)

Multi radio devices - Additional entities will be created for the second Zigbee radio, including Zigbee firmware updates, temperature sensor, router reconnect button, and firmware type. (Note: the Zigbee restart and flash mode buttons are shared between both radios.) Requires core firmware `v2.8.x` or later.

- [SLZB-MR1](https://smlight.tech/product/slzb-mr1/)
- [SLZB-MR2](https://smlight.tech/product/slzb-mr2/)
- [SLZB-MR3](https://smlight.tech/product/slzb-mr3/)

Core firmware on your SLZB-06x device must be `v2.3.6` or newer. If you have an older `v2.x.x` version, you can update from within Home Assistant. If you have `v0.9.9`, update using the [SMLIGHT web flasher](https://smlight.tech/flasher/#SLZB-06) before installing this integration.

## Data Updates

The **SMLIGHT** {% term integration %} will poll for sensor updates every 5 minutes, except for the internet connectivity sensor which is checked every 15 minutes. Firmware updates for both core and Zigbee are checked once per day.

## Supported functionality

### Sensors

The following sensors will be created:

- **Core temperature** - Temperature of core ESP32
- **Zigbee temperature** - Temperature of Zigbee CC2652 or EFR32 chip
- **Core uptime** - Uptime of Core device
- **Zigbee uptime** - Uptime of Zigbee connection to ZHA/Z2M
- **RAM usage** - Monitor RAM Usage
- **FS usage** - Monitor filesystem usage
- **Connection mode** -  Connection mode - Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or USB
- **Ethernet** - Ethernet connection status
- **Internet** - Internet connection status
- **VPN** - WireGuard VPN client connection status
- **Wi-Fi** - Wi-Fi connection status
- **Firmware channel** - Channel for updates, stable, or development firmware or currently installed firmware.
- **Zigbee type** - Current mode of Zigbee chip. Coordinator, router, or Thread. Only works with official firmware installed via OTA in SMLIGHT web UI.

### Buttons

The following buttons will be created:

- **Core restart** - Restart core ESP32
- **Zigbee restart** - Restart Zigbee CCCC2652 or EFR32 chip
- **Zigbee flash mode** - Trigger the Zigbee chip into bootloader flash mode so it can be flashed. It is possible to flash Zigbee firmware over a network socket once this is activated.
- **Reconnect Zigbee router** - Place the router into pairing mode to join a new Zigbee network. This is only created if the SLZB-06x device is in Zibgee router mode.

### Switches

The following switches will be created:

- **Auto Zigbee update** - This allows the core firmware on SLZB-06x to manage Zigbee firmware updates and it will automatically install updates when they are released.
- **Disable LEDs** - Disable all LEDs on the SLZB-06x device.
- **LED night mode** - Enables night mode, which turns off the LEDs overnight, based on the times set in SLZB-06x web UI.
- **Enable VPN** - Enable WireGuard VPN client (requires configuration via the SMLIGHT web UI).

Switches update in real-time if the settings are changed from the SLZB device web interface.

### Updates

The following update entities will be created:

- **Core firmware** - Core firmware updates of SLZB-06x firmware
- **Zigbee firmware** - Firmware updates of Zigbee chip

The updates offered in Home Assistant will match your currently installed firmware. This is based on the firmware channel (dev, release) and for Zigbee also on the firmware type (coordinator, router, Thread). If you wish to switch channels, install the different firmware type in the SMLIGHT web UI. You will get notifications when new firmware updates are available to install.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}

## Known Limitations

Certain advanced features are not supported directly within this integration and must be configured through the SLZB device's web UI:

- Switching the firmware update channel (for example, stable or development).
- Changing firmware modes (for example, Zigbee coordinator, Zigbee router, or OpenThread).
- Configuring security settings.
- Adjusting network settings.
- Setting up the WireGuard VPN client.

## Troubleshooting

- In the unlikely event you encounter issues after a firmware update, you can always downgrade the firmware to a previously stable version using the device's web UI.

- If you require access to the SLZB device over IPv6, this can be enabled on the device's web UI.

For any problems with the integration, [open an issue on GitHub][1] and include the device diagnostics from the SMLIGHT integration page. Including diagnostics will help identify and address the issue more efficiently.
