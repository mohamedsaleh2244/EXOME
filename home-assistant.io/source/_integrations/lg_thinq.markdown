The **LG ThinQ** {% term integration %} allows you to connect LG ThinQ devices to Home Assistant. The features of this integration include:

- Control LG appliances as Home Assistant entities through the LG ThinQ Connect API.

## Prerequisites

- This feature works via LG ThinQ cloud. Therefore, an internet connection is required.
- A [personal access token](https://connect-pat.lgthinq.com) to use the LG ThinQ Connect API.

### Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Access the **[personal access token](https://connect-pat.lgthinq.com)** page (requires an LG ThinQ account).
2. Select **ADD NEW TOKEN**.
3. Enter a new token name and select the following authorized scopes:
    - **Permission to view all devices**
    - **Permission to view all device statuses**
    - **All device control rights**
    - **All device event subscription rights**
    - **All device push notification permissions**
    - **Permission to inquiry device energy consumption**
4. Select **CREATE TOKEN**.
5. Once all the steps are completed, you will see that a **PAT** has been generated.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

1. Enter the information to use LG ThinQ Connect API:
   - The **Token Value** obtained through the PAT issuance process. (Required)
   - The entry name.
2. Choose the region (country).

## Troubleshooting

### Setup

#### Aborted: The token is not valid

This error occurs when the Personal Access Token (PAT) is invalid or entered incorrectly. Please visit the [Personal Access Token Page](https://connect-pat.lgthinq.com) page to check if your token is valid.

#### Aborted: The country is not supported

Check your PAT's valid country in the **Choose the region / Country** section.

#### Error: The number of API calls has been exceeded

This error occurs when there's an abnormal number of API calls made using the PAT.
The LG ThinQ integration will work properly after some time.

## Debugging / Issue report
The LG ThinQ integration will show additional information by enabling log configuration.
1. [Enable debug logging](/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#enabling-debug-logging).
   - If you change **Enable** to **Disable**, the log will be saved to the download folder.
2. When reporting an issue:
   - Provide screenshots of your device configuration (including device name, type, and entities).
   - Include the debug logs.
   - Describe the expected behavior and what's not working.
