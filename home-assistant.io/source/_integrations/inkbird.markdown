While many devices can be updated without active scans, some entities, including the battery sensor require active scans.

## Discovery

The INKBIRD integration will automatically discover devices once the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is enabled and functional.

Most devices require active scans to be discovered.

## Troubleshooting

The IAM-T1 model only reports the temperature unit periodically and may display outdated temperature readings. If the values seem outdated, press the **°C/°F** button (located under the cover) **twice** to refresh the data.
