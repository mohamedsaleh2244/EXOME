The **APC UPS Daemon** {% term integration %} is used to integrate with UPS devices from [APC](www.apc.com) when the Network Information Server ([apcupsd](http://www.apcupsd.org/)) is configured on the APC devices. Use case: When the Notify integration is set up in Home Assistant, you can send notifications. For example, when the UPS switches to battery power, or when the battery level drops low. You can also use it to track the UPS load.

## Supported devices

Generally any device supported by [apcupsd](http://www.apcupsd.org/) is also supported by this integration. This includes most APC UPS models, such as Smart-UPS models and simple signaling models like Back-UPS models.

## Prerequisites

1. Install apcupsd.

    First, install [apcupsd](http://www.apcupsd.org/) on the machine connected to your UPS. It works on Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD, Solaris, and more.  
    You can usually install it through your operating system’s package manager.


2. Configure apcupsd for network access.

    - Open the `apcupsd.conf` file (usually found in `/etc/apcupsd/`) and make sure it’s set to listen for network connections.  
    - Look for the lines: `NISIP 0.0.0.0` and `NISPORT 3551`.
    - This setting allows it to accept connections on all network interfaces on port 3551.  
    - If you prefer, you can set this to a specific IP address and port that Home Assistant can reach.

3. Start the apcupsd service.

## Examples

### Send me a push notification when UPS load is high

{% raw %}

```yaml
alias: "APC UPS Load High Notification"
description: "Notify when APC UPS load is too high"
mode: single
triggers:
  - trigger: numeric_state
    entity_id:
      - sensor.apc_ups_load
    above: 80
conditions: []
actions:
  - action: notify.notify
    data:
      message: "APC UPS load is high: {{ states('sensor.apc_ups_load') }}%"
```

{% endraw %}

## Data updates

The integration {% term polling polls %} data from your APC UPS Daemon every 60 seconds by default.

## Known limitations

This integration does not allow you to control the UPS. For example, you cannot run a self-test. To run a self-test, use the `apctest` command provided by [apcupsd](http://www.apcupsd.org/).

## Troubleshooting

### Failed to connect

If you get a **Failed to connect** error when setting up the integration (and/or `ConnectionRefusedError: Connection refused` errors in the Home Assistant logs), it means that Home Assistant is not able to connect to the APC UPS daemon. Please check if the `NISIP`/`NISPORT` in the apcupsd configuration file is properly configured. Additionally, try running `apcaccess` on the host machine to see if the daemon is working properly.

### Some entities are no longer provided

If certain entities are missing after a Home Assistant restart, it's likely because they represent event-based data that only appears after specific UPS events (for example, transfer to battery). These entities are cleared when the APC UPS Daemon restarts and won’t reappear until the corresponding event occurs again.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
