### Binary Sensor

The binary sensor platform provides the following functionality:

- state of the washer/dryer machine door (open/closed)

### Climate

The `whirlpool` climate platform integrates Whirlpool air conditioning systems into Home Assistant, allowing control of the appliance through the user interface. The current inside temperature is also displayed on the thermostat card.

The following actions are also available:

- [**set_hvac_mode**](/integrations/climate/#action-climateset_hvac_mode) (`off`, `heat`, `cool`, `fan_only`)
- [**target temperature**](/integrations/climate#action-climateset_temperature)
- [**turn on/off**](/integrations/climate#action-climateturn_on)
- [**fan mode**](/integrations/climate#action-climateset_fan_mode) (`low`, `medium`, `high`)
- [**swing mode**](/integrations/climate#action-climateset_swing_mode) (`off`, `horizontal`)

### Sensor

The `whirlpool` sensor platform integrates Whirlpool Washer and Dryer systems into Home Assistant, allowing views of the machine state, time remaining, and the "wash & go" tank fill status as sensors for each device.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
