This {% term integration %} allows you to use [Azure storage accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) for use with Home Assistant Backups.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% configuration_basic %}
Storage account name:
  description: "The name of the storage account. Only the name, nothing else."
Container name:
  description: "Blob container name to store the backups. If the container does not exist, it will be created. Defaults to `hass-backups`."
Storage account key:
  description: "One of the two storage account keys. Used to authenticate against the storage account"
{% endconfiguration_basic %}


## Known Limitations

- Only storage accounts that have a default URL `storageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net` are supported at this point
- Since only key based authentication is possible, this has to be enabled in your storage account.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}

## Troubleshooting

{% details "Authentication failure" %}

Check that your storage account allows [`Shared Key` access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/shared-key-authorization-prevent?tabs=portal#remediate-authorization-via-shared-key).

{% enddetails %}

{% details "DNS Error" %}

You may encounter a `aiodns.error.DNSError: (4, 'Domain name not found')` error. 

To resolve this:

1. Navigate to **Settings → System → Network → DNS Servers** in Home Assistant
2. Manually set fallback DNS servers to `1.1.1.1` (Cloudflare) and `8.8.8.8` (Google) (or any other that you prefer). This allows Home Assistant to resolve Azure domain names successfully.
3. Restart Home Assistant to propagate the new settings.
