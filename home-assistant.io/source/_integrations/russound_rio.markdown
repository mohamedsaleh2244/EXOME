The **Russound RIO** {% term integration %} allows you to control Russound devices that make use of the RIO protocol.

The platform automatically discovers all enabled zones and sources. Each zone is added as a media player device with the enabled sources available as inputs. Media information is supported if the selected source reports it. The integration allows you to navigate presets, control volume of all zones, and play radio stations all from your Home Assistant dashboard.

## Data updates

Russound RIO devices push data directly to Home Assistant, enabling immediate updates for device state changes, media information, and playback status.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.

## Available configuration entities

The integration provides a few entities to configure the device settings. The following entities are supported:

- Bass and Treble
- Balance
- Loudness
- Turn on volume

## Playing media

Russound RIO supports recalling AM/FM and Sirius XM presets using the `media_player.play_media` action. 

### Examples:

Russound RIO can recall any stored presets saved on the device for a given source. The preset ID can be between 1-36. Some devices may display presets within banks of six presets total. The preset ID can be calculated by combining the current bank and preset. An example action using a preset for Bank 1, Preset 1:

```yaml
action: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.russound_deck
data:
  media_content_type: "preset"
  media_content_id: "1"
```

An example action using a preset for Bank 2, Preset 1:

```yaml
action: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.russound_deck
data:
  media_content_type: "preset"
  media_content_id: "7"
```


The action will only impact the current source for a zone. If you want to recall a preset on a specific source, you can use the format `source_id,preset_id`. For example, if you want to recall Bank 2, Preset 2 using Source 1:
```yaml
action: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.russound_deck
data:
  media_content_type: "preset"
  media_content_id: "1,8"
```

## Browsing media

The Russound RIO integration allows you to browse saved presets from your dashboard. 

## Troubleshooting

### There is a delay on getting the current status

Some older Russound devices have a slight delay before posting a new status to Home Assistant. 
This can be resolved by updating the unit to the latest firmware.
