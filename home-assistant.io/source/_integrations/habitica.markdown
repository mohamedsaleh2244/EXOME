The **Habitica** {% term integration %} enables you to monitor your adventurer's progress and stats from [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) in Home Assistant and seamlessly integrates your to-do's, daily tasks, and many more things.

## About Habitica

Habitica is a gamified task manager and habit tracker that turns your daily goals and to-dos into a role-playing game, helping you stay motivated and productive while earning rewards and leveling up your avatar.

## How you can use this integration

The Habitica integration lets you automate task management, such as creating to-dos when appliances finish or marking dailies complete using smart sensors. You can visualize tasks and stats in Home Assistant dashboards or create notifications for due tasks, keeping you organized and on track with your goals.

## Prerequisites for Habitica integration

- To set up the Habitica integration, you must first have an active Habitica account. You can register for an account at [Habitica.com](https://habitica.com/).
- During the setup process in Home Assistant, you can choose between two login options:
  - "Login to Habitica", which allows you to log in with your *username* or *email* and *password*.
  - "Login to other instances", which requires your `User ID` and `API Token`. The `User ID` and `API Token` can be retrieved by logging into your Habitica account, navigating to the **Settings** menu, and selecting **Site Data**.
  - Additionally, you will need to provide the URL for the Habitica instance you wish to connect to; the default URL is `https://habitica.com`, but you can specify a different URL if you are using an alternative Habitica instance or a self-hosted instance.

## Automations

Get started with these automation examples for Habitica, each featuring ready-to-use blueprints!

### Auto-accept quest invitation

Automatically accepts quest invitations from your Habitica party and creates a persistent notification to inform you when a quest has been successfully accepted.

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/habitica-auto-accept-quest-invitation/791002" %}

{% details "Example YAML configuration" %}

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.habitica_pending_quest_invitation
    from: "off"
    to: "on"
actions:

## Data updates

This integration syncs with Habitica every 60 seconds to keep your own data up to date.
Party data, including any party members you’ve added as sub-entries, is refreshed every 15 minutes.

## Known limitations

Habitica imposes a rate limit of 30 requests per minute for third-party applications, which applies collectively to all tools and integrations you use.

This integration performs the following requests:

- 3 requests per data update (every 60 seconds).
- 1 request per action, such as executing skills or interacting with to-dos and dailies.
- 1 additional request 5 seconds after an action to sync the data with Habitica.

Please keep these limits in mind to avoid exceeding Habitica's request allowance. Efforts are ongoing to optimize the integration and reduce the number of requests it makes.

## Troubleshooting

The Habitica integration relies on an active internet connection to communicate with **Habitica**. If you encounter issues, verify that your network connection is stable. Additionally, the Habitica service itself may experience downtime, whether unexpected or due to scheduled maintenance. In these trying times of uncertainty and challenge, when fate tests your resolve, seek guidance from the [Habitica Outage Instructions](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Outage_Instructions) on the community-maintained Habitica wiki — wisdom shared by adventurers who have faced such trials before.

In any case, when reporting an issue, please enable [debug logging](/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#debug-logs-and-diagnostics), restart the integration, and as soon as the issue reoccurs stop the debug logging again (*download of debug log file will start automatically*). Further, if still possible, please also download the [diagnostics](/integrations/diagnostics) data. If you have collected the debug log and the diagnostics data, provide them with the issue report.

## Removing the integration

This integration can be removed by following these steps:

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}
