The **Music Assistant** (MA) {% term integration %} allows you to connect Home Assistant to a [Music Assistant Server](https://music-assistant.io/). Once configured, all [MA Players](https://music-assistant.io/player-support/) show up as Home Assistant [media player entities](/integrations/media_player/).  Media players will allow you to control media playback and see the currently playing item.

## Prerequisites

Before installing this integration, ensure you have a running Music Assistant server. Instructions for installing the Music Assistant server are available in the [Music Assistant documentation](https://www.music-assistant.io/installation/)

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

### Manual configuration

Under normal circumstances, Home Assistant automatically discovers your running Music Assistant server. If there is something special about the Home Assistant or Music Assistant setup (for example, the Music Assistant server is running as a remote Docker container) or discovery is not working, you can manually specify the URL to your Music Assistant server.

## Supported functionality

There is currently support for the following Home Assistant Platforms:

- [Media player](#media-player-entities)
- [Button](#favorite-current-song-button)


All of the Home Assistant [Media Player Control Actions](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/media_player/#media-control-actions) are supported.

If using `media_player.play_media`, then note the `media_content_id` payload can be any of the following:

- The name of a track, artist, or album. For example, `Queen`.
- A track or album combined with the artist's name. For example, `Queen - Innuendo`.
- A streaming provider URI. For example, `spotify://artist/12345`.
- A streaming provider URL. For example, `https://open.spotify.com/track/31cWPvM99ZHxMl3mdgiw4I`.

If using `media_player.browse_media`, then the `media_content_id` payload must be a URI of the form `library://artist/1`, `library://album/20`, or `spotify://album/5zj4Ej0FrlJQaSo0d6cttH`. The type of item that the URI refers to must be an album or artist.

These URIs can, for example, be obtained from the output of the `get_library` or `search` actions described below or the `media_player.browse_media` action from Home Assistant. 

Streaming provider URLs can be obtained from the web interface of the provider.

### Media player entities

The Music Assistant integration creates media player entities for all players and groups available in MA, including those imported from Home Assistant. This is needed to provide the full functionality Music Assistant has to offer. This full functionality includes transfer of the playing queue of music from one player to another, automatic pausing of playback during announcements, and richer options for selecting the media for playback. These entities will display media information, playback progress, and playback controls.

### Favorite current song button

The Music Assistant integration creates a button entity for each player to favorite the current song. Pressing this button (manually or by automation) adds the current song to your Music Assistant favorites. This works for songs stored locally as well as for tracks from streaming providers. It also works with remote content such as Spotify Connect, AirPlay, or a radio station, as long as the external source provides an artist and title combination (and optionally the album). 


## Actions

### Action `music_assistant.play_media`

Play media on a Music Assistant player with more fine-grained control options. This action is more powerful than the [`media_player.play_media`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/media_player/#action-media_playerplay_media) action because it allows multiple items to be added to the queue at once, it allows more specific control of the media item to be played (e.g. a track from a specific album can be specified) and Music Assistant's radio mode (where the queue is filled with similar tracks to that enqueued) can be enabled.

- **Data attribute**: `media_id`
  - **Optional**: No.

#### Example

This example will start playback of ten random tracks.

```yaml
script:
  create_random_queue:
    mode: single
    sequence:
      - action: music_assistant.get_library
        data:
          limit: 10
          media_type: track
          config_entry_id: 01JEXNDHT21V0BHJXM7A5SZANV
          order_by: random
        response_variable: random_tracks
      - action: music_assistant.play_media
        data: 
          media_id: {% raw %}"{{ random_tracks['items'] | map(attribute='uri') | list }}" {% endraw %}
          media_type: track

        target:
          entity_id: media_player.ma_kitchen_speaker

### Action `music_assistant.get_queue`

Get the queue details of a Music Assistant player queue. This provides programmatic access to comprehensive information about the current and next media item in the queue. This information could be used to create a bespoke media dashboard.

- **Data attribute**: `entity_id`
  - **Optional**: No.
  - **Description**: The entity_id of the player holding the queue to be retrieved.
  - **Example**: `media_player.kitchen_speaker`

#### Example

This example sets the name of the currently playing track in an [`input_text`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_text/) which could then be used on a dashboard.

```yaml
script:
  get_now_playing:
    mode: queued
    alias: "Get Now Playing Track Name"
    sequence:
      - action: music_assistant.get_queue
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.ma_kitchen_speaker
        response_variable: queue_info
      - action: input_text.set_value
        data:
          entity_id: input_text.now_playing 
          value: {% raw %}"{{ queue_info['media_player.ma_kitchen_speaker'].current_item.name }}" {% endraw %}
```
  
## Notes

- Any Home Assistant players added to Music Assistant will appear duplicated as the MA version of the player is created. The original HA player can be hidden if desired.

## Supported devices

This integration requires Music Assistant server version 2.4 or later. The integration can connect to Music Assistant servers hosted as an add-on or in a separate Docker container.

Music Assistant supports a [wide range of devices](https://www.music-assistant.io/player-support/) both natively and through the [Home Assistant provider](https://www.music-assistant.io/player-support/ha/). The Home Assistant provider, when installed, allows any Home Assistant media player to appear as a player in Music Assistant and thereby benefit from the advanced playback functionality that Music Assistant provides. As a general note, if there is a native Music Assistant provider then devices should be added via that method instead of using the HA media player. Any limitations associated with the providers are described on the related Player Provider page in the [Music Assistant documentation](https://www.music-assistant.io/).

## Known limitations

The data returned by the `get_queue` action will be partially limited if the item is not in the library (For example, if an item was selected for playback directly from Spotify). Metadata such as favorite status, explicit status, last played, played count, and disc art URL are only available for items that are in the MA library.

Radio mode is only available with certain music providers, and an error will be shown if attempting to enable radio mode on an item that isn't linked to one of those providers. Review the [Music Assistant documentation](https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/#summary) to identify which providers support this functionality.

## Troubleshooting

### Can’t find the MA actions

#### Symptom: No Music Assistant actions are shown in the editor

When trying to set up a script or automation via the GUI, no MA actions can be found.

##### Description

This means the add-on may have been installed, but the integration has not.

##### Resolution

Go to the [Configuration section](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/music_assistant/#configuration) and install the integration.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal.

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}

After deleting the integration, go to the {% my supervisor_addon title="**Settings** > **Add-ons**" addon="music_assistant" %} and remove the **Music Assistant** add-on from there as well (if installed).
