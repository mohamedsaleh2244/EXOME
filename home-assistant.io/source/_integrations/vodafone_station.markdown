      at: "05:00:00"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      target:
        entity_id: button.vodafone_station_xxxx_reconnect_fiber
```

### Automation: notify connected device not home

  actions:
    - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
       data:

## Data updates

This integration {% term polling polls %} data from the device every 30 seconds by default.

## Additional info

### Device tracker

**Note**: If you don't want to automatically track newly detected devices, disable the {% term integration %} system option `Enable new added entities`.

## Troubleshooting

### Can’t set up the device

#### Symptom: "User already logged-in"

When trying to set up the integration, the form shows the message "User already logged-in".

##### Description

This means that there is already a logged session to the Vodafone Station router.

##### Resolution

To resolve this issue, log out from all active sessions, or, if the session was abruptly closed, wait for the router timeout (usually 60 seconds).

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
