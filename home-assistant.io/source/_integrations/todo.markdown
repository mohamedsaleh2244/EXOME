The **To-do list** {% term integration %} provides to-do list {% term entities %}, allowing other integrations
to integrate to-do lists into Home Assistant. To-do lists are shown on the **To-do lists**
dashboard for tracking items and whether or not they have been completed.

{% include integrations/building_block_integration.md %}

For example, [Local to-do](/integrations/local_todo/) is a fully local integration to create to-do lists and tasks within your Home Assistant instance, [Shopping list](/integrations/shopping_list) specifically for shopping that can be added to with Assist, or other integrations work with online services providing to-do list data.

## Viewing and managing to-do lists

Each to-do list is represented as its own entity in Home Assistant and can be
viewed and managed on a to-do list dashboard. You can find the to-do list dashboard
in the main sidebar of your Home Assistant instance.

## The state of a to-do list entity

The state of a to-do list entity is a number, which represents the number of
incomplete items in the list.

</p>

In addition, the entity can have the following states:

- **Unavailable**: The entity is currently unavailable.
- **Unknown**: The state is not yet known.

## Blueprint to add an item to a dedicated list

This blueprint allows you to create a script to add an
item to a pre-configured to-do list.

## Actions

Some to-do list integrations allow Home Assistant to manage the to-do items in the list. The
actions provided by some to-do list entities are described below or you can read more about [actions](/docs/scripts/perform-actions/).

### Action: Get items

The `todo.get_items` action gets to-do items from a to-do list. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [target selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector). The `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                               | Example                     |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `status`       | yes      | Only return to-do items with this status. | `needs_action`, `completed` |

This is a full example that returns all to-do items that have not been completed:

```yaml
action: todo.get_items
target:
  entity_id: todo.vacation_preparation
data:
  status:
    - needs_action
```

This is an example response to the get items action:

```yaml
todo.vacation_preparation:
  items:
    - summary: Water plants
      uid: 01244b28-e604-11ee-a0a4-e45f0197c057
      status: needs_action
    - summary: turn down heating
      uid: ae993df4-e604-11ee-a0a4-e45f0197c057
      status: needs_action
```

### Action: Add item

The `todo.add_item` action adds a new to-do item. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [Target Selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector) and the `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                       | Example                                                      |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `item`         | no       | The name/summary of the to-do item.                               | Submit income tax return                                     |
| `due_date`     | yes      | The date the to-do item is expected to be completed.              | 2024-04-10                                                   |
| `due_datetime` | yes      | The date and time the to-do item is expected to be completed.     | 2024-04-10 23:00:00                                          |
| `description`  | yes      | A more complete description than the one provided by the summary. | Collect all necessary documents and submit the final return. |

Only one of `due_date` or `due_datetime` may be specified.

This is a full example in YAML:

```yaml
action: todo.add_item
target:
  entity_id: todo.personal_tasks
data:
  item: "Submit Income Tax Return"
  due_date: "2024-04-10"
  description: "Collect all necessary documents and submit the final return."
```

### Action: Update item

The `todo.update_item` action updates a to-do item. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [Target Selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector) and the `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                                            | Example                                                              |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `item`         | no       | The name/summary of the to-do item. In some cases, for example if you have items with the same name, it can make sense to use the UID instead of the name. To find the UID of an item, perform a `get_items` action on the to-do list. | `Submit income tax return` or `01244b28-e604-11ee-a0a4-e45f0197c057`|
| `rename`       | yes      | The new name of the to-do item.                                                                                        | Something else                                                       |
| `status`       | yes      | The overall status of the to-do item.                                                                                  | `needs_action` or `completed`                                        |
| `due_date`     | yes      | The date the to-do item is expected to be completed.                                                                   | 2024-04-10                                                           |
| `due_datetime` | yes      | The date and time the to-do item is expected to be completed.                                                          | 2024-04-10 23:00:00                                                  |
| `description`  | yes      | A more complete description than the one provided by the summary.                                                      | Collect all necessary documents and submit the final return.         |

At least one of `rename` or `status` is required. Only one of `due_date` or `due_datetime` may be specified. This is a full example that updates the status and the name of a to-do item.

```yaml
action: todo.update_item
target:
  entity_id: todo.personal_tasks
data:
  item: "Submit income tax return"
  rename: "Something else"
  status: "completed"
```

### Action: Remove item

The `todo.remove_item` action removes a to-do item. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [Target Selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector), and the `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                                            | Example                                                              |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `item`         | no       |The name/summary of the to-do item. In some cases, for example if you have items with the same name, it can make sense to use the UID instead of the name. To find the UID of an item, perform a `get_items` action on the to-do list.  | `Submit income tax return` or `01244b28-e604-11ee-a0a4-e45f0197c057`|

This is a full example that deletes a to-do Item with the specified name.

```yaml
action: todo.remove_item
target:
  entity_id: todo.personal_tasks
data:
  item: "Submit income tax return"
```

### Action: Remove completed items

The `todo.remove_completed_items` action removes all completed to-do items. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [Target Selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector).

This is a full example that deletes all completed to-do items.

```yaml
action: todo.remove_completed_items
target:
  entity_id: todo.personal_tasks
```
