Add an RSS/Atom feed reader that polls feeds every hour and sends new entries into the event bus.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% configuration_basic %}
URL:
    description: The URL of the RSS/Atom feed you want to integrate.
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

{% include integrations/option_flow.md %}

{% configuration_basic %}
Maximum feed entries:
  description: The maximum number of entries to extract from each feed.
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

## Usage

### Automation

Feedreader events can be used out of the box to {% term trigger %} automation actions, e.g.:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Trigger action when new element(s) in RSS feed"
    triggers:
      - trigger: event
        event_type: feedreader
    actions:
      - action: script.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: script.my_action
```

{% raw %}

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Send notification of RSS feed title when updated"
    triggers:
      - trigger: event
        event_type: feedreader
        event_data:
          feed_url: "https://hasspodcast.io/feed/podcast"
    actions:
      - action: persistent_notification.create
        data:
          title: "New HA Podcast available"
          message: "New Podcast available - {{ as_timestamp(now()) | timestamp_custom('%I:%M:%S %p %d%b%Y', true) }}"
          notification_id: "{{ trigger.event.data.title }}"
```

{% endraw %}

The `trigger.event.data` variable contains at least the following keys, there might be more depending on the data the configured feed is providing.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `trigger.event.data.link` | The URL to this feed entry. |
| `trigger.event.data.title` | The title of this feed entry. |
| `trigger.event.data.description` | The description of this feed entry. |
| `trigger.event.data.content` | The content of this feed entry. |

### Event entity

An {% term "Event entity" %} entity will be created for each configured feed which always represents the latest entry of the feed.

### Video tutorial

This video tutorial explains how to set up the feedreader and show a list of news feed items on your dashboard in Home Assistant.

### Event listener

For more advanced use cases, a custom integration registering to the `feedreader` {% term Event %} type could be used instead:

```python
EVENT_FEEDREADER = "feedreader"
hass.bus.listen(EVENT_FEEDREADER, event_listener)
```

To get started developing custom integrations, please refer to the [developers](/developers) documentation

### Other examples

For a drop in packaged complete example of Feedreader, you can use the [PodCast notifier](https://github.com/CCOSTAN/Home-AssistantConfig/blob/22c19375ac5dcb49e0648aa16c431537407aa5e4/config/packages/hasspodcast.yaml).

## Remove the integration
