The **Climate** {% term integration %} allows you to control and monitor HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices and thermostats.

{% include integrations/building_block_integration.md %}

## The state of an HVAC entity

An HVAC entity can have the following states, depending on the specific climate device and its capabilities.

- **Off**: The device is turned off.
- **Heat**: The device is set to heat to a target temperature.
- **Cool**: The device is set to cool to a target temperature.
- **Heat/Cool**: The device is set to heat/cool to a target temperature range.
- **Auto**: The device is set to a schedule, learned behavior, AI.
- **Dry**: The device is set to dry/humidity mode.
- **Fan only**: The device only has the fan on. No heating or cooling is taking place.
- **Unavailable**: The entity is currently unavailable.
- **Unknown**: The state is not yet known.

## Actions

### Climate control actions

Available actions: `climate.set_aux_heat`, `climate.set_preset_mode`, `climate.set_temperature`, `climate.set_humidity`, `climate.set_fan_mode`, `climate.set_hvac_mode`, `climate.set_swing_mode`, `climate.set_swing_horizontal_mode`, `climate.turn_on`, `climate.turn_off`, `climate.toggle`

{% tip %}
Not all climate {% term actions %}  may be available for your platform. You can check which climate action are available under {% my developer_call_service title="**Developer Tools** > **Actions**" %}.
{% endtip %}

### Action: Set auxiliary heat

The `climate.set_aux_heat` action allows you to turn the auxiliary heater on/off for the climate device.

| Data attribute | Required | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | No | String or list of strings that define the entity ID(s) of climate device(s) to control. To target all climate devices, use `all`.
| `aux_heat` | Yes | New value of auxiliary heater.

#### Automation example

```yaml
automation:
  triggers:
    - trigger: time
      at: "07:15:00"
  actions:
    - action: climate.set_aux_heat
      target:
        entity_id: climate.kitchen
      data:
        aux_heat: true
```

### Action: Set preset mode

The `climate.set_preset_mode` action allows you to set the preset mode for climate device. Away mode changes the target temperature permanently to a temperature
reflecting a situation where the climate device is set to save energy. For example, this may be used to emulate a
"vacation mode."

| Data attribute | Required | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | No | String or list of strings that define the entity ID(s) of climate device(s) to control. To target all climate devices, use `all`.
| `preset_mode` | Yes | New value of preset mode.

#### Automation example

```yaml
automation:
  triggers:
    - trigger: time
      at: "07:15:00"
  actions:
    - action: climate.set_preset_mode
      target:
        entity_id: climate.kitchen
      data:
        preset_mode: "eco"
```

### Action: Set temperature

The `climate.set_temperature` action allows you to set the target temperature of a climate device.

| Data attribute | Required | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | No | String or list of strings that define the entity ID(s) of climate device(s) to control. To target all climate devices, use `all`.
| `temperature` | No | New target temperature for climate device (commonly referred to as a *setpoint*). Do not use if `hvac_mode` is `heat_cool`.
| `target_temp_high` | No | The highest temperature that the climate device will allow. Required if `hvac_mode` is `heat_cool`. Required together with `target_temp_low`.
| `target_temp_low` | No | The lowest temperature that the climate device will allow. Required if `hvac_mode` is `heat_cool`.  Required together with `target_temp_high`.
| `hvac_mode` | No | HVAC mode to set the climate device to. This defaults to current HVAC mode if not set, or set incorrectly.
