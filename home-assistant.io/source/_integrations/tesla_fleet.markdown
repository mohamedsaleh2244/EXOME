The **Tesla Fleet** {% term integration %} lets you control Tesla vehicles and energy sites using the [Tesla Fleet API](https://developer.tesla.com/).

## Prerequisites

You need to configure developer credentials and host a public key file to allow Home Assistant to communicate with your Tesla account.

- A [Tesla](https://tesla.com) account with verified email
- A web domain to host your public key file:
  - [NGINX Home Assistant SSL proxy Add-on](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/nginx_proxy/DOCS.md) (recommended)
  - External hosting service ([FleetKey.net](https://fleetkey.net), [MyTeslamate.com](https://app.myteslamate.com/fleet), etc.)

{% warning %}
The China region is currently not supported by this {% term integration %}.
{% endwarning %}

## Tesla Developer Application

Create a Tesla Developer Application to connect Home Assistant with the Tesla Fleet API.

1. Create a developer application:
   - Go to [developer.tesla.com/request](https://developer.tesla.com/request)
   - Select your Tesla account from the dropdown

2. Enter application details:
   - Application name: A name to identify the application
   - Description: Enter a brief description of your integration
   - Purpose of Usage: Explain how you'll use the API (e.g., "Home Assistant")

3. Configure client details:
   - OAuth Grant Type: Select **Authorization Code and Machine-to-Machine**
   - Allowed Origin URL(s): Enter your domain's URL, for example `https://yourdomain.com/`
   - Allowed Redirect URI: Enter `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`
   - Allowed Returned URL(s): Leave this field empty (not required)

4. Select desired API scopes:
   - Vehicle Information (mandatory for vehicles)
   - Vehicle Location (recommended)
   - Vehicle Commands (recommended)
   - Energy Product Information (mandatory for energy products)
   - Energy Product Settings (recommended)

5. Set up billing (optional):
   - Tesla provides $10 monthly credit for personal use
   - You can add billing details later if needed

6. Save your credentials:
   - After creating the application, go to **View Details** > **Credentials & APIs**
   - Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - you'll need these to configure Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

1. Add application credentials
   - Enter your application Client ID and Client Secret from your Tesla Developer Application
   - This step will be skipped if you already have exactly one Tesla Fleet [application credential](/integrations/application_credentials/) already configured

2. Authenticate with Tesla:
   - You'll be redirected to Tesla's login page
   - Enter your Tesla account credentials
   - On the authorization page, select **Select All** and then **Allow** to allow all the scopes you previously selected

3. Redirect to Home Assistant:
   - Confirm you want to **Link account to Home Assistant**

4. Enter domain
   - Enter the domain name you intend to host your public key on
   - This domain should be the same or a subdomain of your origin domain, and must use a valid SSL certificate.

5. Register public key
   - Upload the public key shown to the domain you entered in step 4 at `.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem`

6. Install Virtual Key
   - Use your smartphone to scan the QR code or enter the address to install your public key on your vehicles with the Tesla app.
   - This process needs to be repeated for each vehicle, excluding Model S and Model X vehicles manufactured before 2021.

## Hosting with NGINX Add-on (optional)

1. Create the NGINX configuration:

   ```shell
   echo 'location /.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem {
   root /share/tesla;
   }' > /share/nginx_proxy_default_tesla.conf
   ```

2. Copy the public key shown during setup to `/share/tesla`

3. Configure the NGINX Add-on:
    - Go to **Settings** > **Add-ons** > **NGINX Home Assistant SSL proxy** > **Configuration**
    - Change `customize.active` from `false` to `true`
    - Leave `config.default` at its default value: `nginx_proxy_default*.conf`

4. Restart the NGINX Add-on and verify your public key is accessible at:
 `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem`

## Data updates

The {% term integration %} {% term polling polls %} each vehicle every 10 minutes while it's awake. This is designed to stay within Tesla's $10 monthly credit for most users, which you can monitor usage in the [Tesla Developer Dashboard](https://developer.tesla.com/en_US/dashboard). Energy product APIs are free to use.

If you need different polling intervals, you can [define a custom polling interval](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval).

## Command signing

Certain vehicles, including all vehicles manufactured since late 2023, require vehicle commands to be signed with a private key. All {% term actions %} on vehicle {% term entities %} will fail with an error if this is required and the key has not been setup correctly.

Your public key must be added to each of these vehicles by visiting `https://tesla.com/_ak/YOUR_DOMAIN` and following the instructions in the Tesla app.
If you're using an iPhone, you may need to use Safari to open the webpage and finish the setup.

For more details see [Tesla Fleet API vehicle commands documentation](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-commands#key-pairing).

## Generating your own key pair

The {% term integration %} generates a private key automatically at `config/tesla_fleet.key`. You can replace it with your own key (such as one from another Home Assistant instance) before configuring the integration. You can generate your own key pair following [Tesla's documentation](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/what-is-fleet-api#step-3-generate-a-public-private-key-pair).

## Entities

These are the entities available in the Tesla Fleet integration. Not all entities are enabled by default, and not all values are always available.

## Vehicle sleep

Constant API {% term polling %} will prevent most Model S and Model X vehicles manufactured before 2021 from sleeping. The {% term integration %} automatically stops {% term polling %} these vehicles for 15 minutes after inactivity. You can call the `homeassistant.update_entity` {% term action %} to force {% term polling %}, which will reset the timer.

{% note %} Vehicles manufactured outside of those mentioned above have no issues with prevented sleep. {% endnote %}

## Removing the integration

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}

- Removing the {% term integration %} does not delete your Tesla Developer Application - you can remove it manually from the [Tesla Developer Dashboard](https://developer.tesla.com/dashboard) if no longer needed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Setup errors**: Verify your public key is accessible at the correct URL and you've completed all registration steps with Tesla
- **Command failures**: Ensure `tesla_fleet.key` exists in your Home Assistant config directory and add your public key to vehicles via `https://tesla.com/_ak/YOUR_DOMAIN`
- **{% term Integration %} stopped working**: Use the reconfigure option in {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & services**" %} > **Tesla Fleet**
- **Access to this resource is not authorized**: Check your [Tesla Developer Dashboard](https://developer.tesla.com/dashboard) to ensure you haven't exceeded your usage limits and add billing information if required. In certain countries, the *Fart* (remote boombox) command will also throw this error where its usage is illegal.

If you have an error with your credentials, you can delete them in the {% my application_credentials title="Application Credentials" %} user interface.
