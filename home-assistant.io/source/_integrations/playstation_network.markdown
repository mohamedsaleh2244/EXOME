The **PlayStation Network** {% term integration %} enables you to seamlessly integrate information from your currently playing game in Home Assistant.

## About PlayStation Network

PlayStation Network (PSN) is a digital media entertainment service provided by [Sony Interactive Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment). It allows users to enjoy a variety of gaming-related services such as purchasing games, downloading content, and connecting with other players.

For more information on using notifications, refer to the [Getting Started with Automation](/getting-started/automation/) page.

## Track online status of friends

The **PlayStation Network integration** allows tracking the online status of your friends. To add a friend, go to {% my integration domain="playstation_network" title="**Settings** > **Devices & services** > **PlayStation Network**" %} and select **{% icon "mdi:plus" %} Add friend**.

After adding a friend, a new device will be created with the following entities:

### Sensor

### Image

## Data updates

This integration retrieves data from the PlayStation Network every 30 seconds to ensure timely updates.

Friend status updates occur every 180 seconds. If more than 20 friends are configured, the update interval will be gradually increased to avoid exceeding API rate limits.

## Known limitations

PlayStation Network imposes a rate limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes.

This integration makes 3 requests per data update (every 30 seconds). This presently is well under the rate limit, but leaves room to add additional requests as the integration develops.

Please keep these limits in mind to avoid exceeding the PlayStation Network request allowance.

The Active state for each device is only reported via the API for the last used device. For example, if you start playing a game on your PS4 and without powering down, launch a game on your PS5, the API will only report your PS5 status.

## Supported devices

The following devices are known to be supported by the integration:

- PlayStation 5
- PlayStation 4
- PlayStation 3
- PlayStation Vita
- PlayStation PC

## Unsupported devices

The following devices are not supported by the integration:

- PlayStation Portable
- Other PlayStation system variants (PlayStation TV) or older systems that do not support the PlayStation Network

## Use cases

You can display your currently playing game as artwork on your dashboard.

## Remove integration

This integration can be removed by following these steps:
