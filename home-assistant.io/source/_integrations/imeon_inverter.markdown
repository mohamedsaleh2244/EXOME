The **Imeon Inverter** {% term integration %} will poll an [Imeon](https://imeon-energy.com/) solar inverter in Home Assistant.

## Prerequisites

- The Imeon inverter must be connected to the local network.
- [OS One](https://imeon-energy.com/os-one/) version must be **1.8.1.4** or higher.
- *ModuleAPI* application must be activated on the OS One panel of your Imeon inverter.
   - To do so, connect to **OS One** > **Applications** and by hovering over *ModuleAPI*, select **Activate**.

## Troubleshooting

### What is my domain name?

The domain name is the internal name given to your inverter by Home Assistant. It's based on the initial name you gave to your device, albeit formatted to avoid internal issues.

- A name such as `Imeon Inverter number 57` would give you a domain name of `imeon_inverter_number_57`.
- If you're still struggling to find the domain name, check the internal name of the entities under the device. The name of each variable is `DOMAIN_variable-name`, for example `neo_110_inverter_software_version` tells us the domain name is `neo_110`.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
