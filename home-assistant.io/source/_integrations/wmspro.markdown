The **WMS WebControl pro** {% term integration %} allows you to integrate WAREMA devices into Home Assistant.

This integration uses a local API which is available with firmware container version 11H.

See device section for support information: [buttons](#buttons), [covers](#covers), [lights](#lights),
[scenes](#scenes) and [switches](#switches).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The WMS WebControl pro *may* also be discovered on your local network via DHCP.

## Buttons

- All devices that support an identification activity (for example, winking an awning or blinking a light)
  can be triggered to perform such activity.

## Covers

- *Patio awnings* and *roller shutters/blinds* can be opened, closed, set to a certain position and stopped.
- The integration and library *may* already support other types of awnings or covers with a single motor.

## Lights

- Dimmers (with brightness control) and switches are fully supported.

## Scenes

- Scenes can be activated, but not changed or monitored.
- Scenes are accessible via a virtual device per room.

## Switches

- Load switches (for example, a connected heater) can be turned on and off.
