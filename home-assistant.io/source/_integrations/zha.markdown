The **Zigbee Home Automation** (ZHA) {% term integration %} allows you to wirelessly connect many off-the-shelf [Zigbee-based devices](https://csa-iot.org/csa-iot_products/) directly to Home Assistant, using one of many compatible hardware adapters called _Zigbee coordinators_.

This {% term integration %} currently supports the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Alarm control panel](/integrations/alarm_control_panel/)
- [Binary sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor/)
- [Button](/integrations/button/)
- [Climate](/integrations/climate/) (beta)
- [Cover](/integrations/cover/)
- [Device tracker](/integrations/device_tracker/)
- [Fan](/integrations/fan/)
- [Light](/integrations/light/)
- [Lock](/integrations/lock/)
- [Number](/integrations/number/) (i.e. analog input/output)
- [Select](/integrations/select/)
- [Sensor](/integrations/sensor/)
- [Siren](/integrations/siren/)
- [Switch](/integrations/switch/)
- [Update](/integrations/update/)

## Introduction

The ZHA integration is a hardware-independent Zigbee gateway implementation that can replace most proprietary Zigbee gateways (or bridges, hubs, or controllers). ZHA creates a single Zigbee network to which you can add most Zigbee-based devices.

ZHA uses an open-source Python library called [zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy), so any coordinator that is compatible with zigpy can be used with ZHA. Review [compatible hardware](#compatible-hardware) recommendations before purchasing Zigbee devices.

### Zigbee terminology

- **Zigbee network**: A mesh-network of devices with low-power digital radios using a low-bandwidth communication protocol.
- **Zigbee coordinator**: A hardware radio adapter (typically a USB dongle) that plugs directly into the same computer running your Home Assistant installation.
- **Zigbee router device**: A hardware device that is always mains-powered (AC) such as outlets or fans.
- **Zigbee end device**: A hardware device that is typically battery-powered (DC) such as remotes or motion sensors.
- **Zigbee group**: A collection of two or more Zigbee devices of the same type, different from Home Assistant's [Groups](/integrations/group/).

### Zigbee concepts

- A Zigbee network can have **only one** Zigbee coordinator,
- The Zigbee coordinator can have multiple **Zigbee router** or **Zigbee end devices** connected,
- Each Zigbee router device can have multiple **Zigbee end devices** connected to it,
- A Zigbee device can only be connected to a single Zigbee network,
- Zigbee networks depend heavily on having multiple [Zigbee Router devices](#using-router-devices-to-add-more-devices) to expand coverage and increase device capacity.
- Router devices help pass messages to other nearby devices in the Zigbee network and therefore can improve range and increase the number of devices you can add.

## Compatible hardware

The hardware-independent design of this integration provides support for many Zigbee coordinators available from different manufacturers, as long as the coordinator is compatible with the [zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy) library.

### Other supported but not recommended Zigbee radio adapters or modules

The following hardware is supported, but _not recommended_. Specific models and details are noted where available in each section.

{% details "List of hardware that is not recommended" %}

{% caution %}

- It is **not recommended** to run a coordinator via **Serial-Proxy-Server** _(also called Serial-to-IP bridge or Ser2Net remote adapter)_ over:
  
  - **Wi-Fi**,
  - **WAN**, or
  - **VPN**

- The coordinator requires a stable, local connection to its serial port interface without drops in communication with the Zigbee gateway application running on the host computer.
- Serial protocols used by the coordinator do not have enough robustness, resilience, or fault tolerance to handle packet loss and latency delays that can occur over unstable connections.

{% enddetails %}

If you find an opportunity to improve this information, refer to the section on how to [add support for new and unsupported devices](#how-to-add-support-for-new-and-unsupported-devices).

## Configuration requirements

Be sure to connect a compatible radio module and restart Home Assistant before proceeding with configuration.

ZHA will automatically create a Zigbee network once it is configured with a Zigbee coordinator; you can then add compatible devices.

It is highly recommended to review the guidance for [Zigbee interference avoidance and network range/coverage optimization)](#zigbee-interference-avoidance-and-network-rangecoverage-optimization).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

In the popup:

- Serial Device Path - List of detected serial ports on the system. You need to pick one to which your
radio is connected
- Submit

Press `Submit` and the {% term integration %} will try to detect radio type automatically. If unsuccessful, you will get
a new pop-up asking for a radio type. In the pop-up:

- Radio Type

| Radio Type | Zigbee Radio Hardware                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ezsp`     | Silicon Labs EmberZNet protocol (e.g., Home Assistant SkyConnect, Elelabs, HUSBZB-1, Telegesis) |
| `deconz`   | dresden elektronik deCONZ protocol (e.g., ConBee I/II, RaspBee I/II)                            |
| `znp`      | Texas Instruments (e.g., CC253x, CC26x2, CC13x2)                                                |
| `zigate`   | ZiGate Serial protocol (e.g., ZiGate USB-TTL, PiZiGate, ZiGate WiFi)                            |
| `xbee`     | Digi XBee ZB Coordinator Firmware protocol (e.g., Digi XBee Series 2, 2C, 3)                    |

- Submit

Press `Submit` to save radio type and you will get a new form asking for port settings specific for this
radio type. In the pop-up:

- Serial device path
- port speed (not applicable for all radios)
- data flow control (not applicable for all radios)

Most devices need at the very least the serial device path, like `/dev/ttyUSB0`, but it is recommended to use
device path from `/dev/serial/by-id` folder,
e.g., `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_HubZ_Smart_Home_Controller_C0F003D3-if01-port0`
A list of available device paths can be found in {% my hardware title="Settings > System > Hardware" %} > **dot menu** > **All Hardware**.

Press `Submit`. The success dialog will appear or an error will be displayed in the popup. An error is likely if Home Assistant can't access the USB device or your device is not up to date. Refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below for more information.

### ZiGate or Sonoff ZBBridge devices

If you are use ZiGate or Sonoff ZBBridge you have to use some special usb_path configuration:

- ZiGate USB TTL or DIN: `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `auto` to auto discover the zigate
- PiZigate : `pizigate:/dev/ttyS0`
- Wifi Zigate : `socket://[IP]:[PORT]` for example `socket://192.168.1.10:9999`
- Sonoff ZBBridge : `socket://[IP]:[PORT]` for example `socket://192.168.1.11:8888`

### Global Options

There are a few global options available once ZHA has been configured. Press **Configure** to access these settings.

The options are as follows:

{% configuration_basic %}
Enable enhanced light color/temperature transition from an off-state:
  description: "For older non Zigbee 3.0 lights, this still allows a proper transition from an off-state to a new color (without seeing the old color). _(default: off)_"
Enable enhanced brightness slider during light transition:
  description: "This avoids seeing intermediary brightness state when turning on lights with a transition. _(default: on)_"
Group members assume state of group:
  description: "When using ZHA groups, turning on a ZHA group light makes the ZHA group members optimistically change their state to \"on\", instead of waiting and polling the lights when off. _(default: on)_"
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

### Configuration - YAML

For more advanced configuration, you can modify {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} and restart Home Assistant

{% configuration %}
database_path:
  description: _Full_ path to the database which will keep persistent network data.
  required: false
  type: string
enable_quirks:
  description: Enable quirks mode for devices where manufacturers didn't follow specs.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
custom_quirks_path:
  description: Full path to a directory containing custom quirk modules that will take precedence over any built-in quirks matching a device.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

#### Defining Zigbee channel to use

{% important %}
The best practice is to **not change the Zigbee channel** from the ZHA default.
{% endimportant %}

{% note %}
**Before changing the Zigbee channel on an existing network**, review the following sections on this page:

- [Best practices to avoid pairing/connection difficulties](#best-practices-to-avoid-pairingconnection-difficulties)
- [Zigbee interference avoidance and network range/coverage optimization](#zigbee-interference-avoidance-and-network-rangecoverage-optimization)

These sections both provide helpful advice on improving your Zigbee network performance.
{% endnote %}

ZHA prefers to use Zigbee channel 15 by default. You can change this using YAML configuration, but this only works
if there's no existing network. To change the channel for an existing network, radio has to be factory reset and a new network to be formed. This requires re-pairing of all the devices.

```yaml
zha:
  zigpy_config:
    network:
      channel: 15             # What channel the radio should try to use.
      channels: [15, 20, 25]  # Channel mask
```

The related troubleshooting segments mentioned above will, among other things, inform that if you have issues with overlapping frequencies between Wi-Fi and Zigbee, then it is usually better to first only try changing and setting a static Wi-Fi channel on your Wi-Fi router or all your Wi-Fi access points (instead of just changing to another Zigbee channel).

MetaGeek Support has a good reference article about channel selection for [Zigbee and WiFi coexistence](https://support.metageek.com/hc/en-us/articles/203845040-ZigBee-and-WiFi-Coexistence).

The Zigbee specification standards divide the 2.4&nbsp;GHz ISM radio band into 16 Zigbee channels (i.e. distinct radio frequencies for Zigbee). For all Zigbee devices to be able to communicate, they must support the same Zigbee channel (i.e. Zigbee radio frequency) that is set on the Zigbee Coordinator as the channel to use for its Zigbee network. Not all Zigbee devices support all Zigbee channels. Channel support usually depends on the age of the hardware and firmware, as well as on the device's power ratings.

The general recommendation is to only use channels 15, 20, or 25 in order to avoid interoperability problems with Zigbee devices. Not only because there is less chance of Wi-Fi networks interfering too much with the Zigbee network on other channels, but also because not all Zigbee devices support all channels.

#### Modifying the device type

As not all device manufacturers follow the Zigbee standard, at times a device can be incorrectly classified. For example, a switch could be classified as a light.

To correct the device type, also called domain, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} and restart Home Assistant:

```yaml
zha:
  device_config:
    84:71:27:ff:fe:93:17:24-1:    # format: {ieee}-{endpoint_id}
      type: "switch"              # corrected device type
```

`{ieee}` is the device hardware address which can be read from the Home Assistant UI when looking at _Device info_. From device info, you can find the `{endpoint_id}` by viewing the _Zigbee device signature_.

### OTA updates of Zigbee device firmware

The ZHA integration has the ability to perform OTA (over-the-air) firmware updates of Zigbee devices. This feature is enabled by default. As it uses standard [Update](/integrations/update/) entities in Home Assistant, users will get a UI notification if and when an OTA firmware update is available for a specific device, with an option to initiate the update or ignore that specific update for the device.

To see OTA updates for a device, it must support OTA updates and firmware images for the device must be publicly provided by the manufacturer. ZHA currently only includes OTA providers for a few manufacturers that provide these updates publicly.

**Included manufacturers:**

- IKEA
- Inovelli
- Ledvance/OSRAM
- Sonoff/iTead
- Third Reality

{% warning %}
Before updating a device, you should search for any disadvantages or if you even need to install an available update. Some firmware updates can break features you might use (e.g. group binding for IKEA devices). Some updates might also require changes to ZHA. In rare cases, you can even brick devices by installing a firmware update.
{% endwarning %}

#### Advanced OTA configuration

OTA for a few manufacturers is enabled by default, currently Ledvance, Sonoff, Inovelli, and ThirdReality. Other manufacturers are supported but disabled by default because their updates may change or remove device functionality, may require you to reconfigure devices, or are contributed by the community and may be minimally tested.

Refer to the [zigpy documentation for OTA configuration](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy/wiki/OTA-Configuration) for more information on additional OTA providers.

## Adding devices

{% tip %}
When adding devices, review the following sections on this page:

- [Best practices to avoid pairing/connection difficulties](#best-practices-to-avoid-pairingconnection-difficulties)
- [Zigbee interference avoidance and network range/coverage optimization](#zigbee-interference-avoidance-and-network-rangecoverage-optimization)

These sections both provide helpful advice on improving your Zigbee network performance.
{% endtip %}

**To add a new Zigbee device:**

1. Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & services**" %}.
2. Select the **Zigbee Home Automation** {% term integration %}. Then, select **Configure**.
3. To start a scan for new devices, on the bottom right corner of the screen, select **Add device**.
4. Reset your Zigbee devices to factory default settings according to the device instructions provided by the manufacturer (e.g., turn on/off lights up to 10 times; switches usually have a reset button/pin). It might take a few seconds for the devices to appear. You can click on **Show logs** for more verbose output.
5. Once the device is found, it will appear on that page and will be automatically added to your devices. You can optionally change its name and add it to an area (you can change this later). You can search again to add another device, or you can go back to the list of added devices.

### Using router devices to add more devices

Most mains-powered devices, e.g., many always-powered wall plugs or light bulbs in your Zigbee network will automatically act as a Zigbee router device (sometimes also referred to as a Zigbee "signal repeater" or "range extender").

Because Zigbee should use a [wireless mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network) to be effective, you will need to add Zigbee router devices to increase the number of Zigbee devices that can be used in your Zigbee network, both in the total number of devices that can be added as well as the total range and coverage of the network. Some Zigbee router devices do a much better job at routing and repeating Zigbee signals and messages than some other devices. You should not have a setup where Zigbee router devices (e.g. light bulbs) are often powered-off.  Zigbee router devices are meant to be always available.

All Zigbee coordinator firmware will only allow you to directly connect a certain amount of devices. That limit is set for two reasons; firstly, to not overload the Zigbee coordinator, and secondly, to encourage your Zigbee network to quickly begin to utilize a "[mesh networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking)" topology instead of only a "[star network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_network)" topology.

The total number of Zigbee devices that you can have on a Zigbee network depends on a few things. The Zigbee coordinator hardware and its firmware only play a larger role in Zigbee networks with a lot of devices. More important is the number of directly connected devices ("direct children") versus the number of routers that are connected to your Zigbee coordinator. The Zigpy library, which the ZHA {% term integration %} depends on, has an upper limit that is 32 direct children, but you can still have hundreds of Zigbee devices in total connected indirectly through routes via Zigbee router devices.

In this theoretical example, a CC2652-based Zigbee coordinator has three CC2530 Zigbee router devices for a total limit of 77 devices:

- Coordinator: 32 Zigbee End devices - 3 routers = 29
- Router one: + 16 devices
- Router two: + 16 devices
- Router three: + 16 devices
- Total device limit = **77 devices**

In practice, you will likely need to add a lot more Zigbee router devices than in this example in order to extend the coverage of the network to reach that many devices.

### Discovery via USB or Zeroconf

Some devices can be auto-discovered, which can simplify the ZHA setup process. The following devices have been tested with discovery and offer a quick setup experience.

## Zigbee groups and binding devices

ZHA supports the creation of Zigbee groups (different from Home Assistant's [Group](/integrations/group/) integration), as well as binding devices to each other. Groups and device binding can be set up independently of each other, but they can be also used in combination (such as binding a device to another group of devices).

### Groups

A Zigbee group is a collection of two or more Zigbee lights, switches, or fans. A Zigbee group can then be controlled using only one command/entity.

{% note %}
While using a native Zigbee group instead of Home Assistant's [Group](/integrations/group/) integration can improve the visual responsiveness, the broadcast commands issued can flood the Zigbee network if issued repeatedly.
{% endnote %}

#### To create a Zigbee group

1. Select the **Configure** button on the ZHA integration page,
2. Choose **Groups** and select **Create Group**,
3. Enter a name for the group,
4. Select which devices to include in the group:
    - At least two devices must be added to a Zigbee Group before a group entity is created.
    - The group should consist of products of the same device type (all lights, all switches, or all fans).

### Binding

Binding a Zigbee device attaches an endpoint from one device to an endpoint of another device (or group).

Commands sent between bound devices bypass ZHA (even when ZHA or Home Assistant are not working) and directly control the targeted device. Binding devices can also allow for faster response times and smoother control.

Before binding devices, note the following:

- ZHA binds remotes to the Zigbee coordinator by default in order to forward click events to Home Assistant.
- Some remotes can only be bound to a single target; you might need to unbind the remote from the coordinator before binding it to another target.
- All remotes have some upper limit as to the number of devices they can bind.
- Not all devices support binding, some only support binding groups, others only devices; refer to the device manufacturer's or the community's documentation to confirm features.

#### To manage bindings of a Zigbee device

{% note %}
**This section only outlines how to manage bindings in general. It will not cover all use cases.**

Prerequisites and steps can vary depending on the device type, manufacturer, and your desired end result.
{% endnote %}

1. Navigate to the Zigbee remote's configuration page,
2. In the options menu (the "three dots" icon) to the right of the **Reconfigure** button, select **Manage Zigbee device**,
3. Select the **Bindings** tab in the pop-up dialog,
4. Choose the device from the dropdown list of _Bindable devices_ (or _Bindable groups_),
5. If the remote is battery powered or low-power, wake it by pressing a button immediately before sending a command.
6. Confirm the Bind or Unbind action:
   - To bind devices: select **Bind** (or **Bind group**), or
   - To unbind devices, select **Unbind** (or **Unbind group**).

## Backups and migration

The ZHA {% term integration %} performs automatic backups of your Zigbee network allowing you to restore/recover the network from a backup or migrate to a different Zigbee Coordinator (radio adapter).

After restoring a Home Assistant backup, you can reconfigure ZHA or migrate to a new Zigbee Coordinator without any loss of your settings or devices that were connected. This can be helpful if your current radio fails or a new radio adapter type/model comes out that you want to migrate to.

Manual backups can also be created from the configuration page under **Network Settings**.

### Migrating to a new Zigbee adapter inside ZHA

ZHA supports migrating the Zigbee network between different Zigbee adapters based on chips from Silicon Labs, Texas Instruments, or ConBee/RaspBee if the backup was made from inside ZHA.

#### Prerequisites

Confirm you meet the following requirements before migrating:

- The previous adapter is used in the ZHA {% term integration %} and _not_ in deCONZ or Zigbee2MQTT.
- The radio type is one of the following:
  - ezsp _(Silicon Labs EmberZNet)_
  - znp _(Texas Instruments Z-Stack ZNP)_
  - deCONZ _(ConBee/RaspBee from dresden elektronik)_
    - Be sure it is running [firmware 0x26700700 (from 2021-08-18)](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/wiki/Firmware-Changelog) or later.

{% details "To migrate to a new Zigbee adapter inside ZHA:" %}

{% important %}
You will not be able to control your existing Zigbee devices until they join the network after the migration. **This can take a few minutes.**

If some existing devices do not resume normal functions after some time, try power-cycling them to attempt rejoining to the network.
{% endimportant %}

1. Go to **{% my integrations title="Settings > Devices & services" %}** and select the ZHA {% term integration %}. Then select the cogwheel {% icon "mdi:cog-outline" %}.
2. Under **Network settings**, select **Migrate adapter**.
3. Plug in the new Zigbee adapter.
   - To minimize interference:
     - Use a USB extension cable.
     - Use a USB 2.0 port or a powered USB 2.0 hub.
     - Keep the Zigbee adapter away from USB 3.0 devices.
     - This [video](https://support.nabucasa.com/hc/articles/26124431414557) shows the effect of interference.
4. Reconfiguration of ZHA starts. Select **Submit**.
   - An automatic backup will be performed.
5. Under **Migrate or re-configure**, select **Migrate to a new adapter**.
6. Select the new Zigbee adapter from the list of serial ports and select **Submit**.
7. Choose what backup to use for migration:
   - **Option 1**: To use the backup that was created during this migration, select **Migrate automatically (recommended)**.
     - This is the quickest way to complete the migration.
   - **Option 2**: To restore a specific, older backup, select **Advanced migration** instead.
     - This will let you select a backup of your choice.
8. In the rare event the new radio requires overwriting the IEEE address (the unique MAC address), you will see the prompt for **Overwrite Radio IEEE Address**.
   - Check the **Permanently replace the radio IEEE address** box and click **Submit**.
   - Selecting this option is required for the migration process to complete successfully.
   - Overwriting the IEEE address may take a while.
   - Both the old and new Zigbee adapters now have the same Zigbee IEEE address.
   - You should not operate the old adapter in the same area unless you change its Zigbee IEEE address.
   - If you do not migrate the Zigbee IEEE address from the old Zigbee adapter, you will have to reconnect many of your devices to keep them working.
9. The migration process is now complete.
   - The old adapter is being reset.
   - For combined Z-Wave and Zigbee adapters, like the HUSBZB-1 adapter, only the Zigbee radio portion is reset.
   - **Info**: You won't be able to control the devices until they rejoin the network.
     - Normally, they rejoin within one hour.
     - You may be able to accelerate that process by power-cycling devices.
10. You can now remove the old Zigbee adapter.

{% enddetails %}

## Troubleshooting

{% note %}
To help resolve any kinks or compatibility problems, report bugs as issues with debug logs.
{% endnote %}

### Limitations

The list of ZHA limitations may not be exhaustive.

{% details "List of ZHA limitations:" %}

**ZHA only supports connecting a single dedicated Zigbee coordinator with a single Zigbee network:**

- The Zigbee Coordinator cannot already be connected or used by any other application.
- Devices currently or previously connected to another Zigbee implementation will need to be reset to their factory default settings before they can be paired/joined to ZHA.
- Refer to each device manufacturer's documentation for reset steps.

**A Zigbee device can only be connected to a single Zigbee Coordinator (only one Zigbee gateway):**

- This is a limitation in the Zigbee protocol specifications, governed by the [CSA (Connectivity Standards Alliance)](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/zigbee/), applying to all Zigbee implementations and not just the ZHA implementation.

**Support for commissioning Zigbee 3.0 devices via "Install Code" or "QR Code" via the `zha.permit` action:**

- This has so far only been implemented for 'ezsp' (Silicon Labs EmberZNet) or 'znp' (Texas Instruments) radio type in ZHA.
- Other radio types are missing support in their respective [radio libraries for zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/) or manufacturer's firmware commands/APIs.

**ZHA does _not_ currently support devices that can only use:**

- The ZGP ("Zigbee Green Power") profile:
  - This is used in a few batteryless self-powered or energy harvesting devices, (such as Philips Hue Click, Philips Hue Tap, and some "Friends of Hue" partnership switches).
- The ZSE ("Zigbee Smart Energy") profile:
  - This is due to the "Zigbee SE" specification not being part of the standard Zigbee 3.0 specification and thus not implemented in most of the Zigbee protocol stacks that are commonly available Zigbee Coordinator radio adapters and modules.

{% enddetails %}

### Knowing which devices are supported

Home Assistant's ZHA {% term integration %} supports all standard Zigbee device types as defined by the [CSA (Connectivity Standards Alliance, formerly the Zigbee Alliance)](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/zigbee/).

**There is therefore no official compatibility list of devices that will work out-of-the-box with the ZHA {% term integration %}.**

{% tip %}
Check out [blakadder's unofficial Zigbee Device Compatibility Repository](https://zigbee.blakadder.com).

This unofficial list contains independent community members' reports _(or device-specific pairing tips)_ for several home automation gateway/bridge/hub software (including open-source Zigbee implementations such as ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT, and Tasmota/Zigbee2Tasmota).

Anyone can help maintain the site by submitting device compatibility information to it.
{% endtip %}

Not all hardware manufacturers fully comply with the standard. This can include:

- Implementing unique (but non-standard) features,
- Not showing all expected entities within the Home Assistant {% term integration %} overview.
- Showing no entities within Home Assistant at all.

Developers (or even advanced users) might be able to work around such interoperability issues by adding conversion/translation code in custom device handlers. For more information, refer to [How to add support for new and unsupported devices](#how-to-add-support-for-new-and-unsupported-devices).

{% note %}
**If a device will not join/pair** at all, review the following sections on this page:

- [Best practices to avoid pairing/connection difficulties](#best-practices-to-avoid-pairingconnection-difficulties)
- [Zigbee interference avoidance and network range/coverage optimization](#zigbee-interference-avoidance-and-network-rangecoverage-optimization)

These sections both provide helpful advice on improving your Zigbee network performance.
{% endnote %}

### How to add support for new and unsupported devices

If your Zigbee device pairs/joins successfully with the ZHA {% term integration %} but does not show all of the expected entities:

1. Try to re-pair/re-join the device several times.
2. Review the troubleshooting sections.
3. Search for similar situations in the Home Assistant [community forum or Discord chat server](https://www.home-assistant.io/help/).
4. Still not working? You may need a custom device handler. This handler will have exception handling code to work around device-specific issues.

#### ZHA device handlers
For devices that do not follow the standard defined in the CSA's ZCL (Zigbee Cluster Library), the ZHA {% term integration %} relies on a project called "[ZHA Device Handlers (also known as "zha-quirk")](https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers)".

The project contains device-specific Python scripts called "quirks" that can resolve compliance and interoperability issues by implementing on-the-fly conversion of custom Zigbee configurations or by implementing manufacturer-specific features for specific devices.

Other Zigbee gateway solutions have similar concepts of using custom handlers/converters for non-standard devices, such as Zigbee2MQTT (and IoBroker) using [zigbee-herdsman converters](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/support-new-devices/01_support_new_devices.html).

If you do not want to create a "quirk" yourself, you can submit a "device support request" as a new issue to the [ZHA Device Handlers project repository on GitHub](https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers/issues).

{% details "To submit a new device support request:" %}

{% note %}

Without device support requests, the community of volunteer developers may not be aware that your specific Zigbee device is not working correctly in ZHA.

Please note that the project relies on volunteers; submitting a new device support request does not guarantee that someone will develop a custom quirk for ZHA. 

{% endnote %}

1. Sign in to GitHub.com (an account is required)
2. Go to the [ZHA Device Handlers project issues page](https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers/issues)
3. Select **New issue** and follow the instructions.
    - New device support requests require the device signature + diagnostic information.
    - You may also need to actively help in further testing or provide additional information to the volunteering developers.

{% enddetails %}


### Best practices to avoid pairing/connection difficulties

If you experience problems pairing a device, verify that you follow best practices to avoid pairing/connection issues:

1. Reduce network interference:
    - Check that your setup and environment are optimized to avoid interference.
    - Interference avoidance is an extremely important topic on its own. Review the tips in the separate section below about Zigbee interference avoidance and network range/coverage optimization.
2. Strengthen your network:
    - Check that you have enough Zigbee router devices (Zigbee signal repeaters or range extenders).
    - If you do not have any, you should add additional mains-powered devices to serve as Zigbee routers.
    - Aim to start with mains-powered devices before adding battery-operated devices. 
      - A "weak" Zigbee network mesh may prevent some devices from being paired (such as a device being too far from a Zigbee router or coordinator). 
    - Zigbee router devices are also needed to increase the maximum of devices that can be connected to your Zigbee mesh network.
    - Some Zigbee devices are not fully compatible with all brands of Zigbee router devices. 
      - Xiaomi/Aqara devices known not to work with Zigbee router devices from Centralite, General Electrics, Iris, Ledvance/OSRAM, LIGHTIFY/Sylvania, Orvibo, PEQ, Securifi, and SmartThings/Samsung. 
    - Better results can usually be achieved by using mains-powered devices IKEA and Nue/3A Home or dedicated DIY routing devices based on Texas Instruments CC253x/CC26x2 and XBee Series 2/3 Zigbee radios.
3. Plan your pairing:
    - Try to pair Zigbee devices where you intend to use them:
      - Avoid pairing next to the Zigbee coordinator if you intend to move its location afterward.
      - Pairing a device next to the coordinator and moving it later can result in degraded connections.
    - If the device you want to add has been previously paired to another network, you will likely need to manually factory-reset the device in order to add/pair it.
    - Some battery-operated Zigbee devices are known to have problems with pairing if they have low battery voltage.
      - Some people have reported replacing the battery on their newly received Xiaomi/Aqara devices solved pairing issues.
4. Be patient:
    - The pairing of some Zigbee devices may require multiple or repeated attempts.
    - Some devices, such as those from Xiaomi/Aqara, may not be fully compliant with Zigbee standards and may therefore require many paring attempts over 10-20 minutes or longer.

### Zigbee interference avoidance and network range/coverage optimization

Sources of interference for radios can lead to connection problems, errors in sending and receiving Zigbee messages/signals, and significant degradation in performance. Implementing some good practicies can serve as a starting point to achieve better signal quality and reception, improved coverage, and extended range.

It is important to understand the known limitations of low-power/low-bandwidth 2.4 GHz digital radios to avoid issues caused by interference or poor placement of your Zigbee radio adapter or devices.

All electric devices/appliances, especially computers and computer peripherals, generate EMI/EMF/RMI (electromagnetic fields that cause [electromagnetic interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference)). This is often called _radio-frequency interference_ or _signal noise_, and it can interfere with signal transmissions over 2.4 GHz radios. It can partially degrade or even fully jam wireless communications between your Zigbee adapter and devices.

Examples of real-world interference sources include:

- Signal noise from USB 3.x ports, 
- Unshielded USB 3.x devices,
- Non-shielded USB 3.x peripheral cables 
    - These are widely known to affect 2.4 GHz radio reception for low-power/low-bandwidth devices.
    - You should always place your Zigbee adapter far away as possible from any potential sources of EMI/EMI/RMI, preferably by using an adequately long shielded USB extension cable connected to a USB 2.0 port.

Zigbee relies on a concept of [mesh networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking) with most mains-powered devices being "Zigbee Routers" that act as signal repeaters and range extenders. Collectively, they transmit data over long distances by passing data messages through the Zigbee network mesh of intermediate devices to reach more distant Zigbee devices. 

{% tip %}
To have a healthy Zigbee network, you need many Zigbee Router devices relatively close to each other in order to achieve good coverage and range.
{% endtip %}

#### Actions to optimize Zigbee Coordinator radio hardware

Common root causes of unreliable performance are often seen with outdated Zigbee Coordinator radio adapter hardware, limited by obsolete chips, bad antenna designs, or old/buggy firmware. You can improve most Zigbee setups by using a good Zigbee Coordinator radio adapter and maintaining it.

- Buy and use a supported Zigbee Coordinator USB adapter based on newer/modern chip hardware.
  - Consider a Zigbee Coordinator USB adapter with an external antenna for more flexibility.

- Update to a later version of Zigbee Coordinator firmware on the existing radio adapter.
  - Most manufacturers usually provide straightforward guides for updating the firmware.

- Try different physical placement and orientations of the Zigbee Coordinator and its antenna.
  - Optimal placement of the Zigbee adapter is close to the middle of the house as possible.
  - Try placing Zigbee Coordinator at some distance away from walls, ceilings, and floors.
  - Try different orientations of the Zigbee Coordinator adapter or its antenna.

While using an older Zigbee Coordinator radio adapter hardware might work, using obsolete hardware and/or old firmware can prevent reliable operation. It is also generally a good idea to upgrade Zigbee Coordinator firmware before troubleshooting any further if and when run into problems with devices.

#### Actions to avoid or workaround EMI/EMF/RMI interference

Since all Zigbee Coordinator radio adapters are very sensitive/susceptible to all types of EMI/EMF/RMI you should always try to optimize the placement of the Zigbee Coordinator and avoid known sources of interference.

- Use a long USB extension cable and place Zigbee Coordinator away from interference and obstacles.
  - Ensure the USB extension cable is adequately shielded (thicker cables usually have better shielding).
  - Place Zigbee Coordinator away from electrical wires/cables, power supplies, and household appliances.
  - Extension cables also makes it easier to try different orientations of the adapter/antenna.

- Avoid USB 3.0 ports/computers/peripherals as they are known culprits of RFI/EMI/EMF disruption. (See Ref. [1](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/327216.pdf) and [2](https://www.unit3compliance.co.uk/2-4ghz-intra-system-or-self-platform-interference-demonstration/)).
  - Make sure to only connect the Zigbee USB adapter to a USB 2.0 port (and not to a USB 3.x port).
  - If a computer only has USB 3.x ports then buy and connect Zigbee Coordinator via a powered USB 2.0 hub.

- Shield any unshielded computers/peripherals/devices by adding all-metal enclosures/chassis/casings.
  - Use shielded USB cables for all external peripherals/devices, especially USB 3.x peripherals.
  - Be aware that metal casings can decrease the performance of an internal/built-in Zigbee Coordinator.

- Avoid Wi-Fi Routers and Wi-Fi Access Points, alternatively change the Wi-Fi channel or Zigbee channel.
  - Place your Zigbee Coordinator away from any Wi-Fi access points and all other sources of WiFi.
  - Wi-Fi frequency ranges can overlap with Zigbee, see the section above on defining Zigbee channel use.

### Problems upgrading Zigbee device firmware via OTA

Before upgrading any OTA firmware, it is recommended to install fresh batteries in the device. OTA firmware updates are power-intensive, and some devices check for a minimum battery level before starting the upgrade. These devices may refuse to initiate the update process if the battery level is too low. However, not all device firmware includes this check.

If Zigbee firmware upgrades do not start on a Zigbee End Device (i.e. a battery-powered product), then note that you usually need to "wake up the device" (e.g. trigger state change or pressing a button if available) so that the device becomes awake and is thus able to receive commands to start the OTA upgrade. The reason for this is that battery-powered products are so called "sleepy devices," so they normally are asleep and only receive commands when the state of the device is changed.

If the upgrade still does not start, then try manually restarting the device by disconnecting the power/battery for a few seconds and try again; then again make sure to activate the device by triggering state change or pressing a button on it right before sending the update request. Sometimes, it also helps to try keeping the device awake by repeatedly pushing a button or triggering state change until you see the first "Updating... " message in the user interface.

Be aware that OTAU (Over-The-Air Upgrade) of Zigbee devices typically takes around 10 minutes per device, if it takes longer then another common reason for Zigbee firmware upgrades not starting, taking a very long time, or even failing, is poor reception or not having a stable Zigbee network mesh. Take action to try to optimize your Zigbee network by avoiding radio frequency interference and adding many Zigbee Router devices (repeaters/extenders) to extend range and coverage. Try to follow all the best practice tips above in the [Zigbee interference avoidance and network range/coverage optimization)](#zigbee-interference-avoidance-and-network-rangecoverage-optimization) section under troubleshooting.

### Zigbee network visualization in ZHA UI

The ZHA configuration UI has a tab to visualize device links in your Zigbee network topology.

The network visualization can help to identify devices with poor connection (that is, low values on the link). You will need to look at the ZHA logs to find more detailed information required for troubleshooting.

The visualization shows multi-hop connections between your paired devices and their reported cumulative values of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Link Quality Indication (LQI).

The exact method in which these values are reported depends on the Zigbee network stack used on each device. LQI values can be modified at each step as the message propagates through the mesh networking matrix.

#### Why some links are missing in Zigbee network topology maps

Missing links between Zigbee end devices (often battery-powered devices) in the Zigbee network visualization map are common. They are generally not a sign of a faulty device if the device is still reporting state changes. This happens with sleepy Zigbee end devices and does not mean that the device is no longer connected.

Some end devices (for example, Xiaomi door sensors) sleep for an extended period, causing the parent Zigbee Router to remove them from its child table via a feature called router child aging. Since using child aging and removing them from the child table is a Zigbee 3.0 feature, this does not always occur because not all Zigbee router devices use child aging.

This is what causes devices to show a missing link. Even though the device is no longer in the child table, the end device can still communicate via the parent Zigbee router.

#### How to interpret RSSI and LQI values

Interpreting RSSI and LQI values can be complex, as metrics of network health and communication quality are provided by the devices themselves, and each device could get to its results in different ways. Unless you are a Zigbee specialist yourself or are guided by one, please ignore those values. They can be misleading. 

{% note %}
It is important to not judge RSSI or LQI values on their own. When troubleshooting Zigbee messages that are being dropped, you must interpret the combination of both RSSI and LQI.
{% endnote %}

{% details "About RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)" %}
RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values are an indicator value of the raw signal strength between two devices. 

RSSI values are negative numbers in -dBm format ranging from 0 to -100 power ratio in decibels of the measured power referenced to one milliwatt. Lower negative values indicate less interference and a good signal. 

The value is a measurement between the endpoint device and the first hop from that device. It may not necessarily show signal strength to the Zigbee Coordinator but instead could be showing signal strength to the nearest Zigbee Router device.

Generally:
- Values -60 and above (meaning -50, -40, etc.) indicate a strong signal and very low risk of losing messages.
- Values at -80 and below (meaning -85, -90, etc.) indicate a "noisy" environment and you may risk losing messages.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "About LQI (Link Quality Index)" %}

LQI (Link Quality Index) values are shown as positive numbers on a scale but can be very hard to interpret for Zigbee and not as useful as an individual metric for troubleshooting. 

This is due to the Zigbee and IEEE 802.15.4 specifications not standardizing how to perform LQI measurements. The LQI value provided by the Zigbee devices is not measured using unified standards from all device manufacturers and Zigbee stacks, and LQI is often only a measure of the last-hop link quality which is not always useful information.

In theory, a positive high LQI value is better, and a lower LQI value is worse. Depending on your devices, that might not always reflect the reality. A good practice is to only include LQI with other types of metrics or data points, not as a standalone indicator.

Vendor-specific examples:

- Zigbee devices based on Silicon Labs EmberZNet stack use positive display numbers for LQI where higher values are better and lower values are worse. 
- Texas Instruments Z-Stack computes LQI for each received packet from the raw Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI) by linearly scaling it between the minimum and maximum defined RF power levels for the radio that in effect provides an LQI value that is based on the strength of the received signal. 
  - This can be misleading in case you have a noisy environment with interference within the same frequency range as the RSSI value may be shown as increased even though the true link quality decreases.
- Other manufacturers and Zigbee stacks measure and calculate LQI values in another way.

{% enddetails %}

### Debug logging

To enable debug logging for the ZHA {% term integration %} and radio libraries, add the following [logger](/integrations/logger/) configuration to {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    homeassistant.core: debug
    homeassistant.components.zha: debug
    bellows.zigbee.application: debug
    bellows.ezsp: debug
    zigpy: debug
    zigpy_deconz.zigbee.application: debug
    zigpy_deconz.api: debug
    zigpy_xbee.zigbee.application: debug
    zigpy_xbee.api: debug
    zigpy_zigate: debug
    zigpy_znp: debug
    zhaquirks: debug
```

### Add Philips Hue bulbs that have previously been added to another bridge

Philips Hue bulbs that have previously been paired to another bridge/gateway will not show up during search in ZHA to add a Zigbee device. **Bulbs must be restored back to their factory default settings**.

{% important %}
**You must factory-reset the device.**

- Simply "removing" them from your old bridge/gateway is not sufficient.
- Be sure there are no other Hue bulbs nearby that have just been powered-on when using this method or you will risk resetting them in this process.

{% endimportant %}

The following reset methods can be used (depending on the bulb version):

- **Zigbee remote:**
  - Steps are outlined below for either the _Philips Hue Dimmer Switch_ or _Lutron Connected Bulb Remote_.
  - The remote does not have to be paired with your previous bridge.
- **Bluetooth via Android app:**
  - Newer Philips Hue bulbs can reset via Bluetooth using the official Android app.
  - This is an option even if the bulb is already paired to a bridge.
- **Hue Thief command-line tool**:
  - Advanced users can use a third-party tool called [Hue Thief](https://github.com/vanviegen/hue-thief/).
  - This requires an EZSP-based Zigbee USB stick.

#### Factory-reset using a Zigbee remote

Icons or button names may vary between generations of remotes. The remote used for resetting does not have to be paired with your previous bridge.

{% details "To reset using a remote:" %}

1. Identify which buttons will be used later to perform the reset (based on the brand of remote):
   - **Philips Hue Dimmer Switch**:
     - Use the **(I)/(ON)** and **(O)/(OFF)** buttons.
     - Button labels or icons may vary based on the generation of Hue remote.
   - **Lutron Connected Bulb Remote:**
     - Use the **2nd (up arrow)** and **4th (light off)** buttons.
2. Turn on the Hue bulb you want to reset.
   - **It is important that the bulb has _just_ been powered on.**
3. Hold the remote near your bulb, closer than 10cm (about 4 inches).
4. Press-and-hold both buttons identified in the first step and continue holding them once the bulb begins to blink.
   - Expect to hold the buttons for about another 10 seconds while the bulb blinks.
   - **Lutron Connected Bulb Remote:** The green LED on the remote should also begin to blink slowly.
5. Release both buttons once the bulb turns off.
   - **Lutron Connected Bulb Remote:** You can release the buttons after the green LED stops flashing on the remote.
6. The bulb will turn back on immediately after to indicate the factory-reset is complete.
   - The bulb is now ready for pairing to ZHA following normal steps for [adding devices](#adding-devices).

{% tip %}
A green light on the top left of the Philips Hue Dimmer Switch remote indicates that your bulb has been successfully reset to factory default settings.
{% endtip %}

{% enddetails %}

If you are unable to reset the bulb using a method above, remove it from the Hue Bridge (if it was re-discovered by the Hue Bridge) and try the procedure again.

### ZHA Start up issue with Home Assistant or Home Assistant Container

On Linux hosts ZHA can fail to start during HA startup or restarts because the Zigbee USB device is being claimed by the host's modemmanager service. To fix this disable the modemmanager on the host system.

To remove modemmanager from a Debian/Ubuntu host run this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge modemmanager
```

### Can't connect to USB device and using Docker

If you are using Docker and can't connect, you most likely need to forward your device from the host machine to the Docker instance. This can be achieved by adding the device mapping to the end of the startup string or ideally using Docker compose.

#### Docker Compose

Install Docker-Compose for your platform (Linux - `sudo apt-get install docker-compose`).

Create a `docker-compose.yml` with the following data:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  homeassistant:
    # customizable name
    container_name: home-assistant

    # must be image for your platform, this is the rpi3 variant
    image: homeassistant/raspberrypi3-homeassistant
    volumes:
      - <DIRECTORY HOLDING HOME ASSISTANT CONFIG FILES>:/config
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    devices:
      # your usb device forwarding to the docker image
      - /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
```

### EZSP error and other log messages

#### NCP entered failed state

When you see `NCP entered failed state. Requesting APP controller restart` in logs during normal operation, it indicates a drop in communication between ZHA and the serial interface of the Silabs EmberZNet Zigbee Coordinator.

The EZSP (EmberZNet Serial Protocol) interface used by Silicon Labs EmberZNet Zigbee Coordinator adapters requires a stable connection to the serial port; therefore, it is not recommended to use a connection over Wi-Fi, WAN, VPN, etc.

### Zigbee 3.0 support

Some coordinators may not support firmware capable of Zigbee 3.0, but they can still be fully functional and feature-complete for your needs.

{% note %}
It is up to hardware manufacturers to make such firmware available to them. If your coordinator was shipped with an older firmware version, you be able to manually upgrade the firmware.
