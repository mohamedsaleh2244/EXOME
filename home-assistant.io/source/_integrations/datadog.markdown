The **Datadog** {% term integration %} sends all state changes to [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) using a [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/basic_agent_usage/).

Datadog allows you to analyze, monitor, cross-reference and alert upon your data. You can use it to detect statistical anomalies, see graphs across multiple sources in real-time, send critical alerts to Slack, etc.

The integration also sends events from activity tracking into Datadog, allowing you to correlate these events with your data.

## Setup

You need to have a Datadog agent installed in a network accessible by Home Assistant.

In the [Datadog Agent configuration](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/pkg/config/config_template.yaml#L2203-L2207), you must enable [DogStatsD](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/) non-local traffic to allow StatsD data collection from outside `localhost`.
